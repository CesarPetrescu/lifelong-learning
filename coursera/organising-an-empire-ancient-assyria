# Organizing an Empire

# **1: Introducing Ancient Assyria**

Assyria - Northern part of modern Iraq.

- Assyrian culture is, at once, familiar and strange. Many of us share the Assyrian taste for good wines, but we would perhaps not choose locusts on a stick for nibbles. A fresh water supply, indoor toilets, and a well-functioning sewage system in the family home are as important to us as to urban Assyrians. However, we may find it slightly less essential to have an underground family tomb accessible from the living room.
- We too have a desire to plan for the time ahead and take counsel from those who professionally predict the future, such as weather forecasters and economists. But while the services of astrologists are still popular today as in Assyrian times, many of us would be reluctant to look for information in the entrails of sheep.
- We may congratulate Assyrian buyers on enjoying consumer protection and extended warranties, but we are perhaps taken aback to find that these extended to the purchase of people, who were then subject to a 100-day guarantee against epilepsy and mental instability.
- We too enclose letters in envelopes, but they are not made out of clay. Precisely, the fact that the Assyrians used clay as a writing material is very important for us. Since the archaeological rediscovery of Assyria in the mid-nineteenth century. many of its cities have been excavated extensively in Iraq, Syria, Eastern Turkey and Israel. Further sites in Iran, Lebanon and Jordan provide valuable information. It is because the durable clay was the Assyrians' most common writing material that many hundreds and thousands of original texts have been excavated, inscribed in the cuneiform script. Their language is a Semitic one and related, for example, to Hebrew and Arabic. **Because of the clay tablets, we know so much about so many details of their history and culture, and every year, more are being found.**
- Assyrian history begins in the city of Assur. Assur is situated on the Tigris River close to the modern Iraqi city of Tikrit, best known today as the birthplace of Saddam Hussein. Ancient Assur was founded almost 5000 years ago, long before the imperial period that we will focus on. It started as a trading centre that supplied the cities in the south of modern Iraq with merchandise from Turkey, shipped down the river Tigris. Texts found in Assur and elsewhere document how the city was periodically integrated into larger states centred in the south. But even under the control of such states, for example the Kingdom of Akkad, the Kingdom of Ur, or the Kingdom of Babylon, Assur always managed to preserve a strong cultural identity.
- **Very importantly, the local rulers of Assur did not style themselves as kings. Instead, they asserted that “the god Aššur is king, and I am the representative of the god Aššur”.** The city's god shared the city's name as he was the divine manifestation of the site. The city was founded on a rocky outcrop looming high over the river Tigris and the god Aššur WAS this mountain and therefore, inseparable from the city. The God Aššur was conceived as the sovereign of the city and the state, and it was in his name that the human ruler governed, but not alone. The ruler shared power with the collective citizen body in the city assembly, where the heads of extended families represented their clans' interests. The age of the city-state embedded in larger political structures came to an end three and a half thousand years ago. At this time, in the 14th century BC, in the days of the famous Egyptian Pharaohs Akhenaten and Tutankhamun, Assur's last overlord, a state called Mittani went into decline.
- The then ruler of Assur was called Ashur-uballit, “the God Aššur has kept alive”, possibly referring to his difficult birth. He used his overlord's dwindling power to establish his city as the centre of a territorial state that quickly incorporated most of what is today, northern Iraq. Now, for the very first time, the ruler of Assur adopted the title of king. King Ashur-uballit called his kingdom, the country of Assur, referring both to the God and the city. And we speak today of Assyria, using the classical Greek term.
- **The original kingdom was situated in a triangle between three cities: Assur (near Tikrit) Nineveh (at the site of modern Mosul, northen Iraq's largest city) and Arbela (the modern city of Erbil, the capital of the Kurdish Autonomous Region of Iraq).** This region between the mighty River Tigris and the formidable Zagros mountain range that separates Iraq from Iran constituted the Assyrian heartland. It’s not big- covering an area for about 4000-square kilometres. This is roughly the size of the US state of Rhode Island, or twice the size of Luxembourg.
- From this modest starting point neighbouring regions were gradually integrated as provinces, and their inhabitants were counted as Assyrians. This was justified ideologically by asking for their contribution to the worship of the God Aššur, and this was the basis for Assyrian state taxation. By 1200 BC, Assyria controlled most of its former overlord Mitanni's holdings. The western borders of the kingdom reached the Euphrates River in modern Syria, and the kingdom asserted itself politically and on the battlefield over the neighbouring states like Babylonia and the Hittite Kingdom. From that time onwards, however, these states weakened and disintegrated as great migrations drastically changed the political and social organisation of their territories. The Aramaeans are one of several populations attested as having been on the move during that time, prompted at least in part by the dryer, and therefore worsened, climatic conditions that made agriculture unprofitable in certain regions of the Middle East.
- **All this is part of a series of connected events today called the Late Bronze Age Systems Collapse.** Assyria too incurred territorial losses during that time but maintained control over its well-protected heartland between the Tigris River and the great mountain barriers. In the political discourse, the Aramaeans were now cast in the role of the destructive intruders, whose unlawfully snatched territories must be absorbed back into the kingdom of Assyria, their rightful owner.
- Despite the loss of territory, Assyria's political set-up remained stable. It also never lost its chariot troops as it could afford socially and financially to maintain this highly specialised and effective branch of the armed forces. This and the realm's extent - which greatly exceeded that of the dozens of tiny territories controlled by Aramaean clans - gave the kingdom an advantage in the subsequent wars of conquest. These wars began 3000 years ago in the 10th century BC.
- Two generations later, Assyria’s former maximum extent had been reestablished. Now, the kingdom underwent a major transformation. The outcome is today called the Assyrian Empire, the first such state in world history. In this MOOC, we will focus on the Assyrian way of organising an empire. Our starting point will therefore be the year 879 BC, when the capital was moved away from the city of Assur and the God Aššur, to the newly created mega-city of Kalhu, profoundly changing the political organisation in the king's favour.

## Talking about the Environment/Living Conditions

- No, there are certain parts of the Middle East that are desert, but those are not the only physical features of the Middle East. The south of Iraq is indeed, climatically speaking, desert. But because we had these two large rivers, the Euphrates and the Tigris, moving through the desert zone, irrigating that desert zone, they aren't actually desert. Those are incredibly, intensively used agricultural regions, extremely productive, and have been very, very productive ever since the 4th millennium BC, so for the past 6,000 years.
- The north of Iraq is an entirely different region. The climate there is Mediterranean. That means that there are pronounced seasons. So cold winters with a lot of rain, then a nice spring where everything grows, a hot dry summer, and then autumn that sort of mediates the transition between the hot, hot, hot summer and the very cold winter. So that that Northern Iraqi climate is pretty similar to what you'd have in Italy, in Greece, parts of Anatolia.
    - And it may be confusing [LAUGH] it's called Mediterranean when it's not at the Mediterranean. But it's of course part of a climatic region that starts at the eastern Mediterranean, and then moves along the Taurus Mountains that separate Turkey and Syria and Iraq from each other, and then down the Zagros Mountains that form the barrier between Iraq and Iran. The climate of Iran is largely shaped by the mountains. It's basically a series of mountain chains with high plateaus, some of them transitioned by very big rivers. And that is very far really from sort of the typical deserts that you would have in mind.
- But there are some remote regions that however are not very important for us when we are thinking about the Assyrian Empire. **For the Assyrian Empire, Syria is another important region. And Syria does not really easily fall either into this desert climate nor is it all Mediterranean in character.** A large part of Syria is steppe, and the main problem is that those regions that are far away from the Euphrates River cannot really be irrigated very easily. But these regions still have a lot of promise to human endeavours because you can use them for your herds. You can graze your herds there. And that's why the idea of the desert has very little to do really with the reality of living in the Assyrian Empire. It is however, of course, reinforced a lot by films that are shot in Tunisia. But are supposed to take place either in Syria or in Iraq or in Iran.

### Weather

- Again, dependent entirely on where in the empire the person would be living. So if you live in what is today the south of Iraq, so in this region that is shaped basically by the Euphrates and the Tigris rivers, in this intensely used agricultural zone, you wouldn't really notice much variety of weather, there wouldn't be any pronounced seasons. And that's still the case of course today. Once in a while it might rain, but that would be like a freak incident because on the whole, this is a very dry climate. All the water that is available to people doesn't come down from heaven, but comes down with the big rivers.
- If you live in the north of Iraq which was the Assyrian heartland, as we said that's Mediterranean climate. So you would have very pronounced seasons. And therefore, you would have rainy autumns, cold winters, sometimes snow coming down even as far as modern-day Mosul. And you would have lovely springs, flowers everywhere, and very, very dry arid summers.
- And if you live in the steppe, you would also have seasons to a degree because the steppe is lovely and green in spring. And that's when you would move in with sheep folks. In many ways the climate shapes people's lifestyles a great deal.

### Climate Impact on People

- Well, first of all, one has to stress that while by and by, the climatic conditions in the Middle East now and 3,000 years ago would not have been vastly different, yeah? There are of course, differences, yeah? There are always once in a while is a little ice age like in the 1600s. And then temperatures are cooler, and everything is basically more humid.
- In the time that we are interested in, so from let's say 900 to 600 BC, this would have been comparatively speaking, a cooler, more humid period, yeah? Compared to what happened before and what happened after, yeah? But on the whole, what I just said goes also for that time, yeah? However, there is the risk zone that we must mention. So the Mediterranean climate zone, as we said, we've got rains in autumn. And that's of course very, very important for agriculture, if you farm, yeah? If you don't have the rain, you are in deep trouble, yeah?
- So, it's very, very important to have enough rain. And basically, you need about 200 millilitres of rain a year, which isn't a great deal to reliably farm, yeah? And the boundary between the 200 millilitres and less than 200 millimetres shifts always. It's different for every year, of course. And one has to emphasise that one of the most important cities in the Assyrian Empire is the city of Assur. And that is nowadays outside of this region that enjoys 200 millilitres of rainfall, yeah? That was very, very certainly not the case in the early first millennium, for example, yeah? But there is this risk zone.
- Which sort of affects large parts of the Middle East. That risk zone is called a risk zone because this is where the 200 millilitres are either available or they're not. And basically, if you've got too little rain for two, three, four years, it makes agriculture very unprofitable.
- So the Middle East, in the past and to a degree even today, is shaped by the coexistence between people that farm, that do agriculture, and what we call pastoralists. People that keep herds of sheep, as we say, sheep and goat, yeah?
    - And these flocks would be able, of course, to make the most of spring in the steppes, yeah? When the steppe is green for a very short period in spring, that's the time when you'd bring your animals out into the steppe. And they would be able to eat, to feast even, yeah? And so that's, in a way, how you are able to make the most of the fact that you can't always be 100% sure that agriculture will allow the whole population to flourish, yeah? So you have a mixed risk strategy.
    - The Assyrian heartland in the North of Iraq would be predominantly a farmer's world, one can say. Northeastern Syria, that would be farming as much as possible, but always heavily supplemented by income derived from the flocks, yeah? And the people that would travel with these sheep and these goats, you can't call them nomads. Because they don't have a lifestyle that is only traveling, traveling, traveling, yeah? >> Right. >> They are part of a community, but they will leave this community for several months at a time. >> In the spring season. >> In the spring season. >> Yes. >> **l**>> Right. >> And the important thing is that this is not entirely separate from the farming lifestyle, of course, yeah? >> Yeah. >> So you'd have members of a town, let's say, or a family even that would be farming the fields. And others of that same community would leave the settlement periodically in spring and go away with the sheep.
    - In autumn, the sheep would come back, of course, or even in late summer, and would eat basically the stubble left on the field after those had been harvested. >> So when would the slaughter happen? >> Well, obviously, before the winter. >> Yes. >> Yeah, you'd slaughter the male animals, especially, before the winter comes. Because you don't want to feed them with fodder that you've stocked unless you absolutely must. And basically, it means that most male animals would get slaughtered in autumn, after they've been fattened up over the spring into summer. And only the female animals would be left because they, of course, they will get young ones in spring.
- So we've got our farmers that basically lead a lifestyle that is recognisable to any farmer today, living with the seasons, bringing out to seed onto the fields in spring, waiting for everything to grow over the summer, and harvesting in autumn. Then having a sort of more restful winter and then everything starts again in spring. So the big, big, labour shortage is typically then in autumn, yeah? >> Right, yes. >>
- And then you also have the shepherds. They had to have sort of complementary lifestyle, of course, also very much living with the season, but invading, let's say, those parts of the land that are not at all suitable for the farmer.
- And then we've got the south of Iraq which is a totally different environment that is largely unaffected by natural seasons. But people still live with the same seasons as the farmers and the pastoralists. Because otherwise, it wouldn't make a lot of sense. >> This is part of one integrated world. But one thing, of course, defines that world, and that is when the rivers flood. >> Right. >> And the rivers flood when the rain comes. So the rain comes in winter, and especially then when the snow in the mountains melts. >> Yes. >> And that means that the south of Iraq is irrigated in spring, at the same time, when the farmers in the north of Iraq have done actual rain, yeah? And that's why, this is an integrated system that largely operates alongside our normal, our western pattern of seasons, spring, summer, autumn, and winter.
- And one has to point out that in Egypt, for example, where we also have this big river that basically irrigates a desert landscape, the seasonal pattern is completely different. Because the flood happens at another time.
    - **The flood happens in late summer, autumn, when the monsoon rains bring water to the areas where the Nile has its springs.**
    - Yeah, well, these very different environments are all connected, let's say by these two big rivers, Euphrates and Tigris. And that's why people feel that they live in an integrated world because the rivers are the most important communication routes, of course. And as we said, they do live in this yearly pattern, that despite these different regions having very different lifestyles, still bring them together. So that's quite important.
    - So on the whole, the weather shapes everyone's world even when the weather is largely absent. As is the case in the south of Iraq. And the weather in the risk zone is much more important, of course, than in the south of Iraq. In the south of Iraq, even if the rains aren't as good as they should be in autumn, you will have your flood, yeah? Because the flood is so powerful that what you have to do as a farmer when the flood comes is to protect your fields against the water. So you build dams, you have sluices, and so on and so forth. Water management, artificial irrigation, is as much about keeping the water away.
    - From where you don't want it as it is about bringing the water to you where you want it to be, yeah? So even a bad year for the farmers up north would be an okay year, a perfectly normal year, for the people in the south. Up in the north however, if it rained just a little bit too little would be a huge problem. And there was really not a lot you could do apart from mitigating against that risk in the first place, which they have been doing ever since the Neolithic Revolution, when people started in the one hand to farm and on the other hand to breed animals. So that's a very clever strategy, yeah? So you basically know that there will be bad years. And that's why you basically store food and why have a mixed economy. In the south, you largely have a sort of monoculture that is very, very dependent on certain crops, although they also, of course, breed animals.
- In the north, this fickleness of the weather leads to the prominence of the weather god, yeah, or the storm god. >> [LAUGH] >> As he's also called. That deity is quite important everywhere in the Middle East. But sort of takes on different guises, yeah? In this risk zone, the weather god tends to be the most important deity. It's often seen as the storm god rather than a generic weather god. And is a very fickle deity, yeah, causing thunderstorms, being able to sort of make the desert bloom, but on the other hand, also causing earthquakes and god knows what. In the south, that same deity, under the same name, Adad is the name that the Assyrian have for the deity, is seen in a quite different guise, as a sort of bureaucrat, almost. He's the great canal master, so he is the one who takes care of the heavenly dams and sluices, yeah?
- Irrigating and preventing the water from reaching the regions where you don't want them. And so the weather in the north and in what's today's Syria and Northern Iraq is seen as something that can be benevolent, but can also be very, very damaging, can be even catastrophic. >> Right, yes. [LAUGH] Okay, well, I feel like this is an excellent time where we can stop. And this is a very nice opening to our next segment which will be about temples and religious life.

## Focus on Writing in Assyria

The most important sources for our understanding of ancient Assyria are written sources, and that's why we should discuss how we know how to read these sources, and why these sources are preserved in the first place. 

![Untitled](Organizing%20an%20Empire%2081a77c1360bd4f7cbbb1170f7f1e274c/Untitled%201.png)

- Here, you see an image of two Assyrian scribes recording booty from Babylonia. As you can see, the two scribes have different materials in their hands.
    - One has a floppy, floppy scroll in his hand, the other is much more rigid book-like thing. And both of them have writing instruments in their hands. They are quite different.
    - The first scribe has a leather scroll in his hands, and he would be writing on that leather scroll with a pen and ink.
    - The second scribe holds a writing board in his hands. In this case, a two-hinged one that you could open and close like a book. Its surface would be covered with wax, and into this wax the scribe would inscribe his characters of cuneiform script.
- Cuneiform script is a script that is typical of ancient Mesopotamia, and it's inscribed with a stylus, and we see the scribe holding the stylus in his hands. So these two writing materials are used for different scripts. On the one hand, the ink, the pen, the scroll for letters in Aramaic for an alphabetic script, and on the other hand, the clay tablet or the writing board with the stylus for cuneiform.

![Untitled](Organizing%20an%20Empire%2081a77c1360bd4f7cbbb1170f7f1e274c/Untitled%202.png)

- So let's have a look at these types of script. This is Aramaic alphabet script. It's written from this direction to this direction, so from the right hand to the left hand and it is an alphabetic script closely related to the Greek, and later Latin script, and derived ultimately from the Phoenician alphabet script. It's used in Assyria to record the Aramaic language, which is one of the languages of the state.

![Untitled](Organizing%20an%20Empire%2081a77c1360bd4f7cbbb1170f7f1e274c/Untitled%203.png)

- The other script is cuneiform. Cuneiform means, in Latin, “wedge-shaped”, and it describes the shape of the individual characters. They are, as I said, impressed with the stylus. So this is a three dimensional script, and every sign is made up of several impressions of the stylus. Here, for example, the sign be, made up of one horizontal wedge and this crooked one, and so on. Lí here with two horizontal ones and then two vertical set inside them.
- So on the surface, something that looks very complex, very unwieldy. But as soon as one is used to thinking in three dimensions, cuneiform is not hard to read, also not hard to write. And it is, in contrast to the alphabet script, the traditional writing system of ancient Assyria and ancient Mesopotamia, to think about the bigger cultural horizon.
    - So the cuneiform script is used as one of the official scripts of the Assyrian Empire and the language that is recorded in this way is the Assyrian language. So on the one hand, we've got Aramaic script and the Aramaic language, and on the other hand, we've got the cuneiform script and the Assyrian language.
- **Both of the scribes are working side by side, and as soon as you understand that they are using different writing materials, you also understand, therefore, that they are writing in different languages.**
    - In many ways, we can link this to the need to delegate and the need to control what is happening far away from the state. And we will revisit at other times the fact that we have these two scribes using different technologies, using different scripts, using different languages recording ultimately the same information.

![Untitled](Organizing%20an%20Empire%2081a77c1360bd4f7cbbb1170f7f1e274c/Untitled%204.png)

- Now, however, we want to turn our attention to letters because letters in the Assyrian Empire play a very very important role, and we'll encounter them at other points. Letters in the Assyrian Empire, when used by the state, have to be written in clay, in cuneiform, and usually in the Assyrian language. They cannot be written in Aramaic. They cannot be written in the alphabetic script.
    - And therefore, letters look like this. This is a shape that is only possible because of the use of a clay tablet. The clay tablet in the inside here is the letter with the text, and on the outside, we've got an envelope also made out of clay. In our case it's broken, of course, in order for you to see what's inside. And the envelope, when intact, would only record the name of the person who wrote the letter or sent the letter, I should say, and the person who was to receive the letter plus the impression of a seal. And we'll talk about the seal in a second.
    - Otherwise, the envelope would be empty and only when you broke the envelope, when you opened the envelope, you'd be in a position to read what was within. So basically, we are dealing with something that is, in concept, very similar to our idea of a letter, but of course, makes use of a very, very different writing material: clay.
- **And one has to stress that in the Assyrian period, we witnessed the spread of the alphabetic script because it is much, much easier to learn and to use than cuneiform.**
    - The alphabetic script has a couple of characters less than 30, like our own of course, and is used in order to record phonetically words, names, information, whereas the cuneiform script has a sign repertoire of several hundred signs, basically, a very very complicated script that falls into two categories: syllables like ma, um, mum, and entire words that can be combined to suit the individual writer.
    - And it is a script that allows the writer to showcase how educated they are. It is possible to use a very simple repertoire of signs- less than a hundred- and you can write anything you like. And then of course, the difference in complexity is not as great compared to the alphabetic script, which uses just under 30 signs.
    - **But depending on social status, depending on context, the scribes like to advertise that they can do much better, that they are not limited to just the basics and they can basically show off.** So that's, in a way, the big advantage of the cuneiform script. It is a much better way to display one's own command of the script.
    - Every piece of writing gives information about the level of education, the cultural context of the writer, and that can be seen as a very, very positive thing in a society, of course, where not everyone could write and read in the first place. As we said, this was something that was quite well-established among the urban elites and certainly in running the state, but there were differences.
- So the Assyrian state, from the ninth century onwards, did employ the alphabetic script: much simpler, much easier to learn, much easier to read. But it insisted on continuing to use the cuneiform script. And for certain contexts, the cuneiform script was the only choice like letter writing, like officials’ letter writing.
    - **And this is very good for us today because, while the example of the Aramaic script that I showed before is preserved as it is inscribed in a piece of ivory, on the whole we have hardly anything left of the huge documentation that once existed because the most frequent writing material was leather.** And that of course doesn't keep; leather rots away and there is no example of a leather scroll from the Assyrian period that would have survived until today. So we have hardly any original documentation in Aramaic.
    - On the other hand, we have thousands of original documents inscribed on clay with cuneiform, and that's why we are very, very happy about the fact that the Assyrian Empire used several scripts for running the show.
    - I have to emphasize that from the start, we always need to understand that half of our evidence is gone for good. We'll never be able to recover it. Every year excavations take place, for example in Northern Iraq, and more cuneiform tablets are being found. Fine. Our evidence is growing when it comes to clay tablets and cuneiform. Our evidence will not grow when it comes to Aramaic because nothing has been preserved. It's all gone.
- So we need to understand that we, as historians, work with a record full of gaps and we are very, very fortunate that the Assyrian Empire in the ninth century did not decide to say, "Hey, there is this new wonderful thing. The alphabetic script, our old enemies, the Arameans, whom we have now incorporated into our state, have been using it all along. They seem to be doing well with that. Let's just jump ship. Let's abandon cuneiform for good. Let's now focus only on Aramaic." **Thank heavens they haven't done this because then we would not have anything to work with.** We would not know any of their texts. Thank heavens they decided to keep a multiplicity of systems around because that enables us to reconstruct so much of their history.
    - There were very good reasons for this to do with supervision, control and checking from a distance. But for now, be aware of the fact that what I say is overwhelmingly based on information from such cuneiform tablets.

![Seal](Organizing%20an%20Empire%2081a77c1360bd4f7cbbb1170f7f1e274c/Untitled%205.png)

Seal

- So I promised that we'd focus also on the sealing. Here is an impression of a cylinder seal. It's, of course, only partly intact because the envelope was opened at a later stage. And here is a modern impression of a cylinder seal from the Neo-Assyrian period and the cylinder seal itself. It's a small stone cylinder, usually made of precious or semi-precious stone, usually about two, two and a half centimetres tall. And all the way around this little cylinder, images were inscribed and sometimes also an inscription. **And if you roll such a cylinder into clay, then you get this. And it is an image that is usually unique. Every person who needed a seal would see to it that they had one that was, in some way, characteristic and special for them.** The idea was that your seal was an extension of your personality. It was something like a signature. It was used in legal context. It was used in order to seal letters as we've seen. But it also served as a talisman, an amulet. A seal was something very, very personal. We will see that another thing that was invented in the ninth century was a type of seal that was not unique, that was copied in many, many copies.
- And we'll discuss this later when we will talk about communication in the Assyrian Empire. But this is a cylinder seal. This is one of a kind. **And with this, the Assyrians who used these tools stood in a millennial-long tradition because the use of cylinder seals is even older than the use of the cuneiform script. And the cuneiform script was invented in the late fourth millennium, more than 2000 years before the events that we are interested in.**
    - The final picture that I want to show highlights where in the world you can see cuneiform tablets best and that's undoubtedly the British Museum where a room has been recently restructured in order to enable the visitors to appreciate how clay tablets would have been stored, for example, in the Assyrian Royal Library in Nineveh.
    - And as you can see, these library tablets were put into shelves pretty much like books. And if you want to see original cuneiform tablets, there is really no better way than to visit the British Museum, because in the mid-19th century, British explorers were among the first to explore the Assyrian heartland, and to excavate, especially in Nineveh. And therefore, the holdings of the palace archives, and the holdings of the palace library in Nineveh, are today in the British Museum. We will draw on these sources a great deal in the following weeks.

## Why Study the Assyrian Empire?

- Why do you study the Assyrian Empire? The Assyrian Empire once dominated the ancient Near East. It was the first empire that instigated a number of policies that really focused on controlling wide areas of the ancient Near East. And so, I'm very interested in the kinds of social repercussions of these changes and policies. What kind of changes do we see in the landscape, and settlements, in policy by the governments, as well as economic changes. All these had major changes not only for the Assyrian Empire, but people who lived in the ancient Near East. And so, we see major transformations happening not only during the time of the Neo-Assyrians but even after. And so, it makes the Neo-Assyrian period a very interesting period to me.
- Well, of all the great empires of the ancient world, the Assyrian Empire is by far the least well-known, I mean, least well-known by people in general. I mean, there's so little about it. And that, of course, means is there's huge archaeological possibilities, and it's particularly fascinating with the intricacies of the cuneiform writing system.
- Because it's an interesting aspect of ancient history, not so well known as the classical world, and open to many surprises and discoveries.
- I started studying ancient Assyria sort of by accident because I knew always very interested in the ancient world and I started off studying ancient history. And I saw listed a course about the ancient Near East and I thought it looked strange- I didn't know very much about it. I discovered that its an area that I think, in contrast to a certain degree to many other areas of study in the ancient world, it's quite a new area of study and therefore it has a lot of space for new discoveries and new contributions, which I think its very exciting. Also my mom used to take me to British Museum when I was small and I really liked the Assyrian palace reliefs, the Kalhu reliefs and the Assurbanipal lion hunt reliefs so I think maybe subconsciously that had an influence.
- To know more about the individual personalities of the Assyrian kings: Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, Assurbanipal and their adversaries. For example, the arrogant Elamite King Teumman, who was beheaded in the heat of battle. I want to know as much as possible about these long dead Assyrian kings and their contemporaries.
- Well, I fell in love with ancient history when I was a child and my parents took me to England. I fell in love with ruined castles and knights in shining armour. And over time, I read about the classical world and then the Near Eastern world and I found Mesopotamia, in particular it's cuneiform writing system, which is sort of a mystery. It looks very peculiar and it sort of became a challenge to try and understand it. I like murder mysteries and so this was a different type of mystery. And then I found the Neo-Assyrian Period. And there's just so many documents. there's fabulous arts, there's a lot of archaeological material. There’s such a vast amount of material and very few people working on it. So that's where I ended up.
- So I study the Assyrian Empire because I am primarily interested in Assyrian literature, in the literature from the Assyrian Empire. It's one of the most important literary corpus from antiquity. The most interesting thing about it is that we're still reconstructing it. And so, I suppose the corpus of Greek texts or Latin texts that are pretty much frozen since they were recovered in the renaissance. We are still reconstructing little by little the corpus of literary text from the Assyrian Empire.
- Dr. Karen: I grew up not far from here in Salzburg in one of the most important Iron Age sites in Central Europe and that’s Hallein with the Dürnberg where Celtic noblemen were buried in tumuli with lots and lots of luxury goods, including things that they really didn't need like chariots and wine sets. And that was because at that time in the sixth and fifth century, the Persian Empire dominated, basically, the world and even in far-away Austria, the people who could afford it, modelled their lifestyle according to a court protocol in far away Persia. And when it came to looking for what to study, I always knew I wanted to do something to do with antiquity. And I had visited Syria for the first time when I was 17 and saw my first sights - mud, mud every where- and stories about what beautiful important cities those once used to be, and I found it very intriguing.
    - So I decided to focus on the Middle East at university. I've studied the Assyrian Empire basically since I was 18 years old, and that had to do a lot with the fact that many of my teachers studied ancient Assyria in different ways. And I was so exposed to Assyria in my first year of university that in a sense, I was brainwashed into thinking it's the most exciting topic in the world. And I still do.
- My Latin and Greek teachers awakened my interest in ancient history at school. When I decided to study antiquity, history beyond the well known Roman and Greek past as well as field archaeology fascinated me. My first far-away excavation took me to an Assyrian site, where I excavated for many more years. The evaluation of the results got me around to study the Assyrian empire.
- As every assyriologist dealing with literary texts, I have studied texts from the so-called Library of Ashurbanipal from the tablet collection of the last important Assyrian king at Nineveh. I have dealt rather with Babylonian culture but we find pertinent manuscripts also in Nineveh. Specifically Assyria? I have dealt with the ritual of the substitute king. So when there was a bad omen which meant the king was going to die the king called himself a farmer - another guy was put on the throne and called king and this guy was put to death and the real king continued to reign because the king was dead. I also studied eunuchs at the Assyrian court so there are many interesting features which you can do studying the Assyrian empire.
- I'm interested in the neo-Assyrian Empire more from the point of view of the outside world than from the perspective of Assyria itself. Which is to say that I have done a lot of work on the peoples of the Zagros Mountains to the east of Assyria, who had intense interactions with the Assyrians - sometimes peaceful, sometimes under treaty obligation, sometimes being attacked by them. And also with the people of Northern Arabia who had similar experiences. So my perspective is more of that of the peoples, who were not necessarily subject to, but interacted with, the Assyrians on the margins of the empire
- It wasn't that I had this intention when I was in second grade, I just want to be sportscaster. But once I had started to learn Hebrew, I realised that there was a whole world behind Greek and the Bible, and that of ancient Egypt and ancient Mesopotamia. And Assyria turned out to be a particularly interesting area for, I would say, two reasons. One is that, in many ways, the Assyrian empire really shaped the world in all sorts different ways, including the fact that the political structures it implemented became the model for later empires such as Babylonian, the Persian, up to the Abbasid, and even the Ottoman empire. And the other one for me, as a scholar, was there’s such a vast variety of sources and so many of them. And it is an exciting challenge to deal with them and to try to turn them into history. So, for example, from the last 100 years of the Assyrian empire, you have royal inscriptions that give you accounts of the deeds of the Assyrian kings. And those, of course, are in many, many ways reflecting a rather ideological stance. But you also have the state archives of these very kings and letters written by spies, provincial governors, and all sorts of other people, to those very kings. And they give you a much more realistic picture of what was really going on. I fell in love with the lions, which are depicted in Ashurbanipal's reliefs of the lion hunt. That was my first year at the university when a lecturer showed us slides of Assyrian reliefs, which he photographed himself in the British Museum.

# Meet the CEO: The Assyrian King

- A rocky crag, called Qal'at Sherqat in Arabic, towers high above a bend of the river Tigris. Shaped like the prow of a ship, this cliff rises 40 meters above the valley, providing shelter and opportunities for the people that first settled there about 5,000 years ago. This is the site of the ancient city of Assur and the temple at its heart. This sanctuary is dedicated to the god Aššur. That god and city share the same name is no coincidence. The city was seen as a manifestation, an extension, another dimension of the deity. The rocky cliff on which the city and the temple in its centre were founded was the god. As a mountain deity, Aššur was inseparable from the city, and the temple at Assur was the god's only shrine.
- A ruler called Ušpia, who lived in the 3rd millennium BC, was credited by the later inhabitants of Assur with the construction of the earliest version of the huge temple complex that occupied the top of the crag. For well over 2,500 years, the people of Assur cared for the sanctuary, until its last manifestation was destroyed in 240 AD during the Sasanian conquest of Mesopotamia.
- The basic relationship of the god Aššur and the Assyrian rulers was defined by their belief that “the god Aššur is king, and I am the representative of the god Aššur”. **For the first half of documented Assyrian history, the title of king, šarru in Assyrian, was reserved only for the god, while the ruler governing on his behalf was known either as waklu, which means “overseer of a group of people”, or iššakku, which means “city lord”, or šangû, the highest sacred office, which we usually translate as “priest”.** These titles emphasise different aspects of his role, and taken together, neatly sum up the basic job description of the Assyrian ruler:
    - That he held an office that was religious in nature, and focused on a specific city, namely Assur, and that he led the city's inhabitants. The ruler was seen as the divinely chosen instrument of Aššur, his human agent and representative invested by the deity's grace with the power and duty to lead. He provided religious and spiritual guidance to the people of his city.
- **But in contrast to the pharaohs of Egypt, for example, who are deemed to be living gods, the Assyrian ruler was not thought to be a god himself, but merely divinely chosen and inspired.**
- His influence was balanced by the political power wielded by the city assembly. Where the heads of Assur's family clans represented the collective citizen body. **The traditional division of power in Assur can be described as a parliamentary monarchy, where the head of state is not actively involved in governmental leadership. This is instead carried out by parliament, in Assur's case, the city assembly.**
- However, in the 14th century BC, the nature of the realm and its organization changed drastically, from a city-state to a territorial state. And when the former overlord, Mittani's frailty was exploited, not only did Assur break free, but it won additional territories by war. The new state included most of northern Iraq, and a century later, also large parts of Syria and some regions in eastern Turkey. **At the same time, also the nature of the Assyrian ruler underwent a dramatic change. Aššur-uballiṭ was the first to take the title of king for himself, thereby openly demanding much more power than any of his predecessors. His traditional religious and spiritual authority was now enhanced by the claim to military leadership. Success in war was seen as divinely granted, and every victorious ruler demonstrated, therefore, that he enjoyed the favor of the god Aššur, as well as the other gods of the rapidly expanding state.** The city-state Assur also had not been known for its prowess on the battlefield, but the kingdom of Assyria was now a leading military power.
- As agent of the god Aššur, King Aššur-uballiṭ was now both high priest, and high commander of the army, and this combination of power made him and his successors the most powerful men in the realm. The parliamentary monarchy of the city-state of Assur turned into the absolute monarchy of the kingdom of Assyria.
- The royal family held a very special status in Assyrian society. Only its male members were eligible to kingship. On occasion, there were usurpations and succession wars, as killing the predecessor did not disqualify the perpetrator from taking the crown. Like victory in battle, prevailing over one's rivals was seen as divine favour and an expression of divine grace. **But all Assyrian rulers, until the disintegration of the kingdom, around 600 BC, were without exception, descended through the male line from this one family, making it one of the longest serving royal houses of all time.** No wonder, then, that the Assyrian king came to be seen as a being not only superior to ordinary humans, but also quite separate from them.
    - According to a poem about the creation of mankind, the gods were thought to have fashioned the king in a separate act after having already created mankind. “Ea, the god of wisdom, opened his mouth to speak, saying to Belet-ili, the goddess of creation, you are Belet-ili, the sister of the great gods. It was you who created man, the human. Fashion now the king, the human advisor. Shape the whole of his figure so pleasingly, make perfect his countenance, and well-formed his body. And Belet-ili fashioned the king, the human adviser.”
    - In accordance to this idea, the Assyrian king was required to be a perfect specimen of a man in body and mind. A eunuch, for example, as a castrated man, was therefore automatically disqualified from kingship due to his mutilation. We will discuss this and other reasons why eunuchs made excellent aids to the royal house in Module Four.
- Some 500 years after Aššur-uballiṭ's first adoption of the title of king, we can observe another big change to the character of the Assyrian ruler. In 879 BC, the city of Assur was stripped of its traditional role as the seat of political power. The royal court, and with it the state administration, moved to Kalhu, an ancient but hitherto unremarkable city some 70 kilometres north of Assur.
- Assyria in the 9th century BC was a state like no other in the region. Once it reclaimed the territories it had lost 200 years before, in the course of the Late Bronze Age System Collapse, the kingdom exceeded its neighbours many times over in extent and manpower.
    - The Assyrian king capitalised on the success of the reconquest, and assumed a new role as overlord over his neighbours. Assyria was now an imperial power, commanding not only its own territories, but also those of the neighbouring states that had to accept Assyrian leadership.
- **The new capital, Kalḫu, was conceived and created to express this new imperial power, its architecture designed to overwhelm and impress anyone who visited it. But the creation of the new centre was also part of a wider strategy designed to strengthen the position of the king at the expense of the old urban elites**. The days when the city assembly of Assur wielded political power in the state were now gone for good. And perhaps even more importantly, by leaving the city of Assur, the king also left the god Aššur behind, who was so deeply and intimately connected to his place.
    - At Kalḫu, there was no temple for Aššur. Many other sanctuaries were erected for the great gods of Assyria, but even combined, their shrines were smaller in size than the enormous royal palace.
    - At Kalhu, the king, and no god, was centre stage of the realm. The king who engineered this truly radical departure from tradition, and who thus emancipated Assyrian kingship from the god Aššur was called **Ashurnasirpal**, the second of his name. The images that he chose as decoration for the throne room in his new palace at Kalḫu were designed to convey a twofold ideological message to all visitors.
    
    ![Untitled](Organizing%20an%20Empire%2081a77c1360bd4f7cbbb1170f7f1e274c/Untitled%206.png)
    
    - The first message was that King Ashurnasirpal controlled all lands making up the empire. To that end, orderly, calm scenes of audiences and tribute delivery showed the king interacting with his dutiful subjects and clients. On the other hand, chaotic, violent scenes of conquest and siege highlighted how the king reacted to resistance.
    
    ![Untitled](Organizing%20an%20Empire%2081a77c1360bd4f7cbbb1170f7f1e274c/Untitled%207.png)
    
    - The second message communicated by the decoration of the throne room concerned the relationship of the king with the god Aššur. This message was communicated in only one image, but this was depicted twice, and in the two most prominent spots in the long hall. On the wall opposite the main entrance, and again at the far end above the platform on which the royal throne stood.
    - In this way, as visitors entered the room, they could not avoid taking notice of the image. It showed King Ashurnarsirpal with the god Aššur, and emphasised that despite the kings radical move away from Assur and the temple of Aššur, the relationship between the god and the king was as close and strong as ever.
    - An angel-like creature, a winged protective spirit, stands behind the king, guarding him. The king raises his right hand in the typical Assyrian gesture of worship to the god. The scene is shown twice, on either side of the god. This is meant to indicate that this was not a particular moment in time, but timeless, eternal.
    
    ![Untitled](Organizing%20an%20Empire%2081a77c1360bd4f7cbbb1170f7f1e274c/Untitled%208.png)
    
    - The god Aššur is shown in human, yet disembodied form as the divine counterpart of the king, in the shape of a bearded man wearing the distinctive fez like headdress of the Assyrian ruler, and holding the emblem of kingship, a circle.
    - A winged disk surrounds his figure, stressing the god's ethereal otherworldliness. It hovers above a holy symbol that we today call the sacred tree. This imagery powerfully suggests that the King did not need the temple at Assur in order to commune with the god. So strong was their link that the blessed king himself served as a conduit to the deity. The king did not not need to be in Assur to be with Aššur.
    - This carefully calibrated message was disseminated across the empire in the shape of portable art such as cylinder seals that copied the distinct image. It played a key part in the fact that the people of Assyria accepted the drastic break with tradition that took the king away from Assur and out of the god's shadow.
    - With Aššur’s blessing, the king's power was absolute no matter where he was. None of King Ashurnarsirpal's successors ever resided in Assur again. Assyria, and with it the world, had come to see the Assyrian king no longer as the pawn of the god Aššur, but as the master of the universe in his own right.

## Talking about Temples and Religious Festivals

- There are very, very many gods in Assyria.The basic idea is that every town, every city is centred on a temple, and that temple is the house where a particular god lives. So at an absolute minimum we have as many gods in Assyria as there are cities.
    - But then most gods would have a partner. So on the whole, the Assyrians believed in monogamy, and so they also thought that their deities were paired up, so you'd have a god and a goddess. And typically, they would have a child, sometimes they would have two or so, you know, very, very much the nuclear family. So in a way you could therefore say at a minimum you would have as many gods as there are cities times three.
    - 100s of deities.
- There's another state in the Middle East which flourishes in the late second millennium, so a couple of hundred years before the time that we're interested in here, which is the 900 to 600 B.C. And it's the kingdom of the Hittites. And one says that the Hittites said, that they worshiped a thousand gods. And you if you asked an Assyrian rather than me, he or she would probably also say a thousand gods. But not all of them were equally widespread, not all of them had as many worshipers as others, and some were definitely far more important and had many, many more temples than others.
- Can you please tell me, as if I have never heard the word before, what actually is a temple? Yeah it's true of course, when I say temple, the Assyrians would have said, “house of a particular god”. A temple is where a god is thought to live, and, at the same time, the temple is also a representation of the deity. So that building is seen to a certain degree, as a second being.
    - The temple has a name, its individual components have names, the door would have a name, the lock would have a name. So it's seen as much more than just a building; it's very much seen as a living creature in a way that is an aspect of the deity but at the same time is also the deity. So that’s quite quite complex and complicated. And so, the temple functions in this way as part of this divine being and on the other hand, it is very much of course architecture, it is a building and it tends to be one of the largest, if not the largest building in a given city.
    - And, it tends to be also in the centre or in a central position within that settlement and it serves very much as the nucleus of the community. So, the community comes together in that temple to worship the god or the gods. Okay. So this actually leads directly to my next question, which is, because in these couch talks we're talking about the average Joe in ancient Assyria.
- So what role do these temples play in the life of an average citizen? So first of all, while the temple is at the centre of the community and, you know, functions as this place where the community comes together in worship of the deity, that doesn't mean that everyone could enter the temple, or all parts of the temple. But a fair number of people would be involved in the worship of the deity.
    - The Assyrians didn't have a clergy in the same way that maybe Christians, or Jews, or Muslims have a clergy. The differentiation between the worshiper and the priest is far more oblique, it's not as black and white. Lots of people would contribute to the worship of a deity and therefore would fulfil priestly functions. And ultimately, everyone who contributed to that worship could be described as a priest. But, that worship centres very much on a kind of daily re-enactment of the gods' life, focusing very much on meals. So that means that participating in worship could mean cooking particular dishes, brewing beer, or pouring wine. Singing is also very important. Dressing the statue that stands in for the deity, of course.
    - So worship is more like a play than a service, a church service or something like that, that is focused very much on a member of a clergy explaining the world to the community. That's not at all what the Assyrians did. For them worshiping is providing for the deity or the gods, we have talked about the fact that they are often seen as living in a family context. The temple is seen as the house of the deity, and more than anything the god is meant to be drawn to the temple by experiencing this care that the people, that the worshipers provide there. The god can go anywhere, but the worshipers, the community, want to go to be present as much as possible in their city, in their temple, and therefore make it very attractive for the deity to be present because there is the wonderful meals that are being cooked and that are thought to be consumed by the deity by smell. It's of course quite handy because it means that even after the deity has consumed the meal, you still have all the food and that is then shared in the community.
- But it's a form of a ritual play, you might want to say, that brings together a community and some of these communities are very large. We are talking about cities with several thousands, or dozens of thousands of inhabitants, coming together in a very elaborate feast that then is shared also by the members of that community. So everyone who contributes to this has access to the temple, but that is not necessarily really everyone in the community.
    - So typically, what develops is a sort of tradition that certain families have certain tasks in the temple, and there always needs to be someone who takes care of this. And of course, some of these feasts for the gods are very simple. If it's a small town, if it's a small shrine, if we are talking about several hundreds of worshipers, then we are not talking about a feast that involves, you know, slaughtering multiple oxen and dozens of sheep every day.
    - But when we talk about the big temples, then we definitely are talking about a feast of that dimension. And on the whole, it focuses very much on the men of the community, not the women. There are, to a certain degree one can really say they are excluded from this entirely, to the extent that when, for example, in terms of the liturgy, in terms of the singing that is required, you want someone to sound like a woman you will have a man sing in a woman's voice.
    - And that's why festivals are very important. So what we've discussed so far, is this routine worship that happens basically every day. The god needs to eat every day. The god also needs to be bathed every day. The god needs to be dressed every day. The god needs to go to sleep every day. So that happens every day. As we said, women typically are not part of that at all.
    - So the religious festivals take care of that problem, in that, religious festivals typically incorporate processions whereby the gods leave the temple and come out into, at the very least, their city. And sometimes they also leave the city and travel to other temples, visit other deities, and then are of course visible to everyone. And they typically are then represented by statues. And everyone can see this. The whole point of these festivals is that the community can see the God, can encounter the God. Some of these festivals then involve elements that we don't quite know how to envisage, for example races. How gods race each other? We don't quite know how that works. Is this people carrying the statues that are doing the racing? We really don't know.
    - And our outings of the divine couple. The god and his spouse visit a garden and dine there, and feast there, and sleep there. Is this done with the statues on their human stand-ins? This is quite unclear, really.
- This is very much part of a calendar, and the religious festivals would therefore have a very very important role in structuring time for people. In time making, if you want. The religious calendar would be very very static.
    - New Year festival, which starts the new year making the link between the festivals and the calendar, very obvious of course. And the new year, in Assyria starts in spring, when everything starts to grow of course.
    - But when states incorporated certain regions with important temples and therefore important ritual calendars, the state in our case, the Assyrian state, tended to incorporate these festivals into the overall state calendar. And therefore sometimes, there were adjustments made in very old traditional cultic calendars, because the state required it.
- How does all of this that you have just discussed relate back to the Assyrian king? As we said, these religious festivals, the role of the temple in the community in a given city or region, is very important.
    - The Assyrian Empire, as a state that grows, that expands, often faces the situation that an important shrine, an important temple, is brought under Assyrian control. So what to do? One way of going about this is to just ignore this and let people do what they've always done, and let this be their regional festival.
    - Another completely different approach is to make this part of the state calendar, and that happens quite often really. And then, we have the Assyrian king immediately now in equation, because as soon as the Assyrian state decides that a temple or a festival or a deity requires state attention, that means that the king becomes part of the worshipping community, whether the original community likes this or not. And that means then that the king adopts the temple, takes on duties, but also rites. And on the surface, that's quite nice for the temple because invariably there will be building works. The king renovates the shrine, but of course, also inscribes then his own inscriptions into the temple, becomes very much part of the fabric of this house of the god.
- We've already described how intricate the relationship between the deity and its building is. So when the king builds the temple, or helps build the temple, then of course, the king becomes part, not only of the temple, of the cult, but also in the way of the God, like a virus. On the other hand, the king also then contributes to the sacrifices, these daily sacrifices. Invariably, when the Assyrian state and the Assyrian king becomes involved, the deity gets a much nicer feast, much more food is served, much better food is served. But of course, the king then also is entitled to share this meal. Again, the king is then very much part of the entire fabric. The festivals also become part of the state calendar requiring then the presence of the king.
    - The king will observe certain functions. The king, like everyone else, can take on certain priestly functions. And of course, will then take on the most important ones. And when that happens, the community to an extent loses control, independence if you will, but benefits because the attention that the state and the king lavish on to the cult, of course, give it larger prominence, attract more worshipers. Such a deity might then perhaps become of interest to communities elsewhere and might get additional temples in other cities, and so on and so forth. But, the temple, the cult, the deity would no longer be tied only to their own community, to their own city, to their own temple.
    - And so therefore, we can distinguish between temples and gods that are of interest to the Assyrian state, and temples and gods that have no interest to the Assyrian state. And both can flourish equally, within the state, but only one of those two categories is sort of under the eye of the king. On the whole, you could say a temple that is not incorporated into the state cult, can flourish as much as temple that has been incorporated. But, it has far less involvement from the state, to fear or to expect, depending on how you see that. **The Assyrian state is not regulating these temples. A temple that is not part of the state cult might be economically less well off. Some communities might deliberately seek to attract the attention of the Assyrian state, because of course it would then mean that you would have a new building with multi-coloured glazed bricks at the facade, gigantic doorways with bronze decorations, nice guardian figures at the gate.** You know that the temple would definitely benefit from this attention. On the other hand, of course, the king would then be very much be the first worshiper in a way. The most prominent worshiper. But the important thing is, in the Assyrian Empire, there were deities that were part of the state cult and others that were not. And to their worshipers of course, they could be equally important.
    
    ## Focus on Petitioning the Gods: The Importance of Divination
    
    We've already discussed that the king is the instrument of the god, Aššur, has a special connection with the god, Aššur, and he's acting on behalf of the god, Aššur. But Aššur is, of course, not the only god in the realm and the king, as the leader of the people, is the most important person holding together the state, had a duty to also take into account what the other gods might be thinking and that's what divination is all about.
    
    **Divination is the discipline or the disciplines that deal with finding out what the future has in store and every leader, of course, has to plan for the future and has to take the future into account.** So now, we want to look at which ways the Assyrian King employed to this end. There are two, we'll start with divination.
    
    ![Untitled](Organizing%20an%20Empire%2081a77c1360bd4f7cbbb1170f7f1e274c/Untitled%209.png)
    
    In this image here, you see two diviners at work. They are leaning over the body of a sheep, a sheep that had been sacrificed before, the head has already been removed and, as you can see, they seem to be staring intently at the belly of that sheep. One of them is holding the legs apart while the other one seems to be investigating the belly area of the sheep. What are they doing? They are reading the liver of the sheep. Now, the context in which this happens is quite important. If we look at the slab of stone wall decoration on the whole, then you can see that this is happening as part of a campaign scene.
    
    It is taking place inside the Assyrian war camp, here down there in that corner. This is a typical depiction of the Assyrian camp and the point that is being made when ever this is shown in the context of war scenes is while there are chaotic scenes of conquest and battle very close by, not in our scene here however, the life in the camp is quiet, is ordered, is well-organised and corresponds very much to life in the Assyrian heartland. Even when the Assyrian king is on a campaign, he takes order with him and he is the person who guarantees this order, this balance even in the most extreme conditions such as in war. **So, that's why life in camp is always shown as ultimately pleasant.** We see people cooking here, serving food, so the living standards of the army are said or shown to be very high. The animals are treated well, we see the horses drinking and being cleaned. And here in the corner, we have our two diviners. And they stand for the fact that **even at war, even in the chaotic scenario of warfare and battle, the king will take care to make informed decisions.** 
    
    Ultimately, we don't know why the sheep liver was seen as significant and why it offered a direct link into the minds of the gods, but Piotr Steinkeller came up with an interesting suggestion. **He argued that the body of the sheep could perhaps be seen as the envelope of a letter that the gods offered to their human questioners and that the liver inside the envelope would be the letter in which their message was inscribed.** That's an attractive idea. Whether it's correct - we don't know because the Assyrians do not discuss the belief system that stands behind it. In any case, the liver was seen as the message that the sun god wished to communicate to whoever had asked him a question. 
    
    The context is a very important one. The sheep was sacrificed to the god and, therefore, blessed, of course. And it was only opened after it had been sacrificed, so if one thinks that the god, Šamaš, is in a position to modify the liver, and that clearly seems to be the idea that stands behind that, then he would only do that after the sacrifice had happened and after the ownership of the sheep had been transferred to him.

    So, it was at this point his liver, his divine message, and the diviners are reading it here, yeah? Okay, so the way this worked was that someone, in our context, the king asked the question and it had to be a yes-no question. **13 points on the liver.** There was a huge body of literature at that point assembled over more than a millennium and this data identified different observations in these particular spots as either positive or negative. So, that's what they did, they knew all this information and then they said, One is positive, two is negative, three is negative and so on, then arriving, therefore, at either a positive assessment or a negative assessment. If, of the 13 points six were negative and seven were positive, the overall answer was yes. If nine were negative, for example, and four were positive, the answer was no. And this answer would be communicated back to whoever had asked the question - in our case, the king who funded all of this because, as you can imagine, this is quite expensive. You have specialists that are versed in this huge body of literature and they have to work under these very specific conditions and you had to have many of them. It wasn't just one group working with the king. There were others that accompanied branches of the army and were in places where they were needed. And that's what our image with the camp scene was meant to highlight.
    
    So, this is how the King asked the sun god Šamaš for his opinion and, of course, this is a very flexible means of inquiring about the future. The king could phrase his question any way he liked, any time he liked, he had to invest the sheep, of course, and that makes it something that is, on the whole, out of the reach of most people. Because the sheep was lost to you, the sheep was given over to the king and while this form of divination was not at all exclusive to the king, it was routinely practitioned only in the context of the state. Other people would, maybe once or twice in their life perhaps, think about doing something like that when they had to make really really tough decisions but would not routinely employ diviners and divination.
    
    Okay, the other form of inquiring about the future is something that we can relate much more easily to, it's astrology. Mesopotamia is the place of origin of astronomy, of watching the stars and, to this end, all of the star signs that we are using today are derived from star signs identified in ancient Mesopotamia, familiar also to the Assyrians. The Assyrian king had scholars in his employ that read the stars and they read heavenly writing, as the Assyrians called it, because that was their word for the constellations on the sky. By reading the heavenly writing, they could get a sense of what the gods wished to communicate to humankind.
    
    And in contrast to divination, where one asked a very specific question and got either a positive or a negative answer back, watching heavenly writing, reading the star signs is much, much more open ended and basically required watching the stars every night and recording what was going on and then trying to extrapolate opinions, trends from this. Certain constellations were very, very strongly associated with the king, with the kingdom of Assyria and when observations were made about these specific constellations, they were thought to intimately concern the fate of the king and the state and, therefore, reported back to the king who adjusted his decision-making in order to suit this. So the two forms of divination that we've discussed: astrology and extispicy (reading the liver) are the two favourite disciplines that the king used in order to make decisions. They are not the only ones that were practitioned but they are the two most important ones for the business of the Assyrian state for running the empire.
    
    ## Assyrian History, Part 1: Leaving Assur
    
    This is the city of Assur. It houses the temple of the god Aššur, and the palace of the kings of Assyria. The temple of Aššur is the only temple for this deity in the entire world because the god is so closely identified with the city and with the rock on which the city is constructed. The king, therefore, shares the limelight with the god Aššur because the king stands very much, in the shadow of his overlord, the god. The king also shares the limelight with the old, urban elites of Assur: old families that can trace back their ancestry for many generations. All this changes in the year 879 BC.
    
    In this year, one king decides to move the political capital to another city called Kalhu. And he appoints one of his new eunuchs, the palace overseer, Nergal-apil-kumu'a, to oversee this move and the construction of a new, much bigger, much better palace in this new capital city.
    
    This king is called Assurnasirpal II, and he moves from Assur to Kalhu with his queen, and they ruled there happily ever after until their death.
    
    During that time, Nergal-apil-kumu'a also assembles the people of Kalhu, a population that is much more closely mirroring the makeup of the empire. And the palace serves as the meeting point between the king and his client rulers. When the king dies, he's buried not in Kalhu, but in the old palace of Assur. And his successor, his son Shalmaneser III takes his throne in Kalhu. When the queen dies, she is buried in Kalhu. And this starts a tradition that continues for the remainder of the Assyrian period. The kings are buried in the old palace in Assur, being reunited with their god in death. Whereas the queens and the rest of the family are buried in the palace in Kalhu.
    
    ## How Do We Know About the Move to Kalhu?
    
    ![Untitled](Organizing%20an%20Empire%2081a77c1360bd4f7cbbb1170f7f1e274c/Untitled%2011.png)
    
    **How do we know about the move to Kalhu in 879 BC?**
    
    There are very, very many sources about it. It moved because Assurnasirpal, the king who moved the Assyrian capital to this new capital city of Kalhu. Assurnasirpal, he used the opportunity to have a new, clean white canvas. And he built lots of buildings, of course, and he used the opportunity to inscribe his inscriptions on these buildings. And one [COUGH] such source this would be this here. As you can see, there is an inscription running across the figure here. In this case, it's an 18 lines long inscription, but there are others where the inscription is slightly longer or slightly shorter.
    
    In the Egyptian Museum in Munich there are a number of such slabs, and they are from Kalhu, that's correct. This image here is a reproduction of a slab that is kept in the British Museum, and the British Museum has most of these slabs. In total, there would have been more than 400 slabs like that. Many show a winged gentleman, like this one here. But there are others from the throne room of Assurnasirpal’s palace that show narrative scenes of conquest, of sieges, of military successes, or of people encountering the king, meeting with the king. And that was the decoration of the throne room. The rest of the official quarters of the palace would have been decorated with these winged figures. They are angels, Assyrian angels, and they are meant to purify and protect this building and the people within it.
    
    And when the palace was first excavated in the mid-19th century by a British explorer and diplomat called Henry Austin Layard, this was the early days of archaeology, so funding worked in [LAUGH] ways quite different from today. And he more or less operated a subscription model. So the British Museum was [LAUGH] his most important funder, but others could also aid with his efforts. And in return, they got then things that he found, most prominently [LAUGH] these wall slabs. 
    
    So that’s why various museums in Britain have copies of such wall slabs. But that’s why some are in India, in Mumbai, in Australia, in the United States, or in Munich for that matter. But they all have one thing in common, and that's this inscription here, which we call Assurnasirpal Standard Inscription. And while the length of the cuneiform lines can vary, the text is always the same, yeah? So the scribes that inscribed the inscription, they were at liberty to arrange the text as they saw fit. And there's great variation in this regard, but the text in terms of content was fixed.
    
    **What’s on the tablet**
    
    So in the last part of the inscription, Assurnasirpal explains how he moved the capital. And he says, “the ancient city of Kalhu, which Shalmaneser I, King of Assyria, a prince who preceded me had built, this city had become dilapidated. It lay dormant. I rebuilt this city. I took people which I had conquered from the lands over which I had gained dominion, (then he enumerates all these lands). So I took people from these lands and settled them therein. I cleared away the old ruin hill, and dug down to water level. I sank the foundation pit down to a depth of 120 layers of brick. I founded therein a palace of cedar, cypress, juniper, boxwood, terebinth, and tamarisk as my royal residence, and for my lordly leisure for eternity.”
    
    So he focuses on the fact that this is now the place from where he governs the empire. And he focuses on the fact that the people he settles in this new city are people that he had assembled from all over the territories of the Assyrian Empire. That he is the one who chooses them. And that's, in a nutshell, of course, what we've described as the key idea behind this move away from the old elites from Assur to a new place where he is the lord in command. He doesn't mention here that he leaves Aššur behind, the god Aššur. He doesn't mention that, because of course in this inscription he very much styles himself the delegate of Aššur, the ruler who rules on Aššur’s behalf. But that would have clear to anyone anyway, that Aššur, the god, was left behind in the city of Assur where his one and only temple remained. So it's inscriptions like this that tell us from Assurnasirpal’s point of view about this move. This is a short inscription, inscribed more than [LAUGH] 400 times, of course, in these wall slabs that served to decorate the palace.
    
    But there are longer inscriptions as well, some visible, some buried deep in the foundations of the new city. And those that were buried were meant to be uncovered by later Assyrian kings when they renovated the city. They were meant to look for these inscriptions, treat them with respect, read them, of course, reflect on the deeds of their predecessor, Assurnasirpal, and then bury them again together with their own new inscription. So the visible ones are the ones that would have been seen at least by people visiting the palace. Whether that means that they would stop, pause, and read the inscription, that's an entirely different matter. You can see that this cuneiform is well visible, but probably the idea was less that people would stop and read. More, the king wished to just show his power because by having 400 of these slabs produced he, of course, could highlight how vast his workforce of scribes and stone masons was, yeah? And it's safe to say that there wouldn't have been a ruler in the world at that time who could have controlled quite so many literate craftsmen as Assurnasirpal. So that's certainly one of the messages that he wished to communicate. Look how educated my people are. Look what I can do. Look how many of these scribes, stone masons I control, yeah.
    
    **So one last question, can you tell me a little bit about this particular hat which I have not seen so much before?**
    
    Yeah, that's a good question. I said that this gentleman is an Assyrian angel, yeah?
    
    So he is a god.
    
    One of the lesser deities of course, but he is a god. And he's an intermediary between the great gods of Assyria and the people of Assyria, so a guardian angel, let's say. And he wears this hat in order to highlight that he is divine, yeah? So this type of hat, which is a round cap with pairs of cow horns- >> Interesting, okay. So it's of course shown from the side. That's a type of hat that is reserved for deities only, yeah? And so this hat by itself is used as a symbol for a god as well. But then it's usually shown from the front, and then you can see more clearly that it's pairs of horns. Why cow horns are seen as an emblem of divinity, I can't tell you. No one knows really. Of course, ancient Mesopotamia is the region where cattle were first domesticated, but this is of course many thousand years before this time. And the cap with the horns is an old symbol by that time. So by that time, it attested for well over 1,000 years. And so it's nothing new at all, it's a traditional symbol at that time. We don't know why these cow horns are associated with the gods, but the reason why, in Christianity, horned creatures are seen as demons is definitely linked to the fact that in ancient Mesopotamia and other pagan societies, creatures with horns were very, very much seen as deities.
    
    ## Two Kings: Tiglath-pileser III and Shalmaneser V
    
    ### **Tiglath-pileser III, king of Assyria (reigned 744-727 BC)**
    
    Assyria's territories were greatly enlarged during the reign of Tiglath-pileser (or Tiglatpileser) III who annexed regions to the west of the Euphrates river and to the east of the Zagros main ridge. In 729 BC, this Assyrian king also seized the crown of Babylon. He seems to have died peacefully of old age and was succeeded by his son and chosen heir, Shalmaneser V (726-722 BC).
    
    ### **Assyria's waning hegemony over the Middle East**
    
    In the first half of the 8th century BC, Assyria found itself in a precarious situation. With the rise of Urartu in eastern Anatolia, Assyrian supremacy was no longer automatically accepted by its western neighbours, the smaller kingdoms in Syria and Anatolia. The treaties binding these states to Assyria and guaranteeing their tribute for the Assyrian treasury were vulnerable as long as swearing allegiance to Urartu was a realistic alternative.
    
    At that time, Urartu's army was certainly Assyria's equal and in 754 BC, just as Aššur-nerari V (754-745 BC) had ascended to the Assyrian throne, Sarduri II, king of Urartu, defeated the Assyrian army in Arpad, an Assyrian vassal state in northern Syria. This glorious achievement was celebrated in Sarduri's inscriptions and was quite clearly a disaster for Assyria: in the succeeding years, Assyrian troops did not leave the borders of Assyria. Only in 749 BC was a new expedition mounted - not against Urartu but instead to the border with Babylonia where Assyrian interests were now endangered as well.
    
    ### **Tiglath-pileser's rise to power**
    
    In 746 BC, a rebellion took place in Kalhu, the main royal residence, and in the following year, Tiglath-pileser III seized the throne. He had certainly supported the revolt against Aššur-nerari V, as had the governors of Assur and Kalhu who were among the very few high officials who remained in power after the coup: the insurrection had clearly started at the very centre of Assyria, with the backing of some of the most senior officials. Many other governors and magnates were replaced, however, probably following their execution after Tiglath-pileser's faction prevailed against those who remained loyal to Aššur-nerari V.

    As we have very few archival texts from the reigns of Tiglath-pileser III's immediate predecessors, we do not know under which name he was known before he became king and, crucially, whether he had been the crown prince. But it is certainly significant that Tiglath-pileser never mentions his father in his royal inscriptions even though the ancestor's name is typically invoked in this context in order to stress the king's legitimate claim to the throne. The omission is especially odd as, according to the Assyrian King List, Tiglath-pileser was the son of his predecessor Aššur-nerari V. Today, it is therefore generally assumed that, although of royal blood, he was a usurper who took the Assyrian crown by force after engineering a coup against his ineffective predecessor.
    
    As king of Assyria, he adopted the throne name **Tukulti-apil-Ešarra**, meaning "my trust belongs to the son of the Ešarra temple". This name refers to Ninurta, the son and heir of Aššur, the head of the Assyrian pantheon. The significance of the name is obscured by the fact that we use "Tiglath-pileser" (or "Tiglatpileser"), a distorted Biblical form of the name, as is always the case when an Assyrian king is mentioned in the Bible: this was, after all, how the knowledge of these rulers survived when the cuneiform script was no longer in use and the memory of the Assyrian empire had faded.

    ### **Creating an empire**
    
    Having established himself on the Assyrian throne, Tiglath-pileser first took the army to the south and decided the situation at the Babylonian frontier in his favour. In 744 BC, he founded two new provinces in the region controlled by the Medes, situated along the important trade route which we know today as the Silk Route: Bit-Hamban, at the headwaters of the Diyala river, and Parsua, further to the east in the Zagros Mountains. The news from Assyria indicated a dramatic shift in the formerly ailing state's fortunes and brought the Urartian army, still under the command of the celebrated Sarduri, back to the Euphrates border: in 743 BC, Assyria and Urartu met once again in battle in Arpad. This time, however, the Assyrian troops were victorious and pursued the Urartian army all the way back to the capital, Turušpa.
    
    It can be argued that it was the decade-long experience of Assyrian vulnerability and impotence, when it was eclipsed and threatened by Urartu and had lost its hold over Syria and Babylonia, that caused Tiglath-pileser and his army to initiate the military campaigns in the west which marked the beginning of Assyria's expansion to the Mediterranean coast, deep into Anatolia and the Zagros mountain range and to the Persian Gulf. Only under Tiglath-pileser did Assyria outgrow its traditional boundaries and was it transformed into what we today call the Assyrian empire.

    After defeating the Urartian troops in Arpad, Tiglath-pileser went on to punish this kingdom for providing Urartu with access to Syria and to Assyria's frontier. His army waged war in Arpad for three years until all resistance was crushed in 740 BC; Arpad's forces had been assisted not only by the Urartian army but also the troops of all its Syrian neighbours. When Arpad was ultimately defeated, the Assyrian army did not leave, as in previous centuries: instead, the country was turned into two provinces and transformed into a permanent part of Assyria.

    The dogged resistance encountered in Arpad meant that the war could not end if the new Assyrian holdings were to be protected. Although the anti-Assyrian alliance had been driven out of Arpad, it remained in existence and was a powerful adversary. Arpad's neighbour to the west was therefore next in line: its close ally, the influential kingdom of Hamaton the Orontes river. Hamat's troops were first defeated in 738 BC and its north-western parts, reaching the Mediterranean Sea, were turned into Assyrian provinces. During this same campaign, Hamat's northern neighbour on the Mediterranean coast, the Neo-Hittite kingdom of Unqu, was conquered and incorporated into Assyria. But the state of Hamat did not collapse and the fight for its independence continued, assisted by its allies Damascus and Israel. This war was decided in Assyria's favour only six years later, in 732 BC, when the troops of Hamat and Damascus were defeated, their countries invaded and permanently annexed; at the same time, Israel was subjugated and the northern half of the kingdom integrated as the Assyrian province of Megiddo.
    
    ### **Tiglath-pileser, king of Assyria and king of Babylon**
    
    During the reign of Tiglath-pileser III, the Assyrian army was transformed into a professional army, with specialised soldiers largely replacing the conscripts who provided military service during the summer months, when the agricultural calendar permitted the absence of farm workers. Soldiers from the defeated kingdoms of Arpad, Unqu, Hamat, Damascus and Israel swelled the ranks of the Assyrian army, supplemented by mercenaries from Anatolia, the Zagros Mountains and Babylonia.
    
    From the beginning of his reign, the Assyrian king had been active in Babylonia: he came to be the archrival of Mukin-zeri, chief of the tribe of Bit-Amukani, who attempted to unite the politically fragmented region under his leadership and assumed the kingship of Babylon in 731 BC. Tiglath-pileser saw this as a provocation and a challenge to Assyria's primacy in the region. He repeatedly led the Assyrian army against Mukin-zeri and ultimately defeated him, taking the crown of Babylon for himself in 729 BC. For the remainder of his reign, Tiglath-pileser ruled both as the king of Assyria and the king of Babylon.
    
    It would seem that most of the income provided by Tiglath-pileser's conquests was invested in the establishment of the professional army and the maintenance of the new provinces. He certainly did not spend his revenue in central Assyria, where he contented himself with building only a new palace in Kalhu, the so-called Central Palace. The decorated stone slabs which served as the wainscoting for the state quarters of this building provide us with Tiglath-pileser's accounts of his conquests. Kalhu was also the burial place of Tiglath-pileser's queen Yaba, whose tomb was discovered underneath the private wing of the ancient Northwest Palace by a team of Iraqi archaeologists in 1988; she was 30-35 years old when she died and was buried with exquisite funerary goods.

    ## **Shalmaneser V, king of Assyria (reigned 726-722 BC)**
    
    The chosen heir of his father Tiglath-pileser III (744-727 BC), Shalmaneser V was king of Assyria and king of Babylon. But his reign lasted less than five years and ended in a succession war which brought his brother, Sargon II (721-705 BC), to power.
    
    ### **Ululayu, the crown prince**
    
    As crown prince, the future Shalmaneser V was known as Ululayu. This fairly common name was certainly his birth name and means "born in Elul (i.e. the sixth month of the Assyrian calendar; c. August-September)". We do not know when Ululayu was promoted to the position of heir apparent to the Assyrian crown but five letters from the royal correspondence found at Kalhu in which he reports to his father, the king, attest to his activities during that period.
    
    These letters have close parallels in the missives sent decades later by Sennacherib (704-681 BC) to his father and king, Sargon II: all of the crown princes' letters - but only these - include the phrase "Assyria is well, the temples are well, all fortresses of the king are well" and there is also an overlap in their remit as far as it emerges from the surviving correspondence. It is likely that this has less to do with their personal interests and more with the office of crown prince which they both held, which was the second highest position within the Assyrian state after the king, outranking even the Commander-in-Chief, the Chief Cupbearer and the Treasurer.
    
    We see the crown prince Ululayu primarily deal with matters concerning the palace household in the king's absence: arranging for the palace to have sufficient supplies, for example of ice which was collected on the mountain peaks to the north and east of central Assyria and transported to Kalhu by river; co-ordinating the protection details for the queen's travels; and receiving ambassadorial delegations visiting the royal palace. Diplomatic relations seem to be one of his major concerns as we also see him monitor the reception of Assyrian state gifts abroad. The known letters show him dealing notably with Assyria's western vassal kingdoms: Carchemish, Kummuhi (Commagene), Gurgum, Que, Sam'al, Ashdod and Moab. He must have acquired a good knowledge of these regions during that time, an excellent preparation for the military campaigns which he conducted against some of these states as king of Assyria.

    ### **A short-lived king and his throne-snatching brother**
    
    After Tiglath-pileser's natural death, Ululayu ascended to the throne without a challenge. Like his father, he ruled not only as king of Assyria but also as king of Babylon. Instead of his everyday name he adopted a glorious throne name, Shalmaneser, meaning "the god Salmanu is foremost". Such a name was only fit for a ruler of Assyria and invoked the memory of distinguished predecessors such as the 13th century king Shalmaneser I and Shalmaneser III (858-824 BC) - both well known for their conquests of regions to Assyria's west. The new king also adopted this political programme and continued the subjugation of the west initiated by his father.
    
    Because of his short reign, very few official documents commissioned by Shalmaneser V survive: a brick inscription from Apku (modern Tell Abu Marya) shows that he undertook building work in this north Assyrian city but otherwise only a set of lion-shaped weights from Kalhu bears the official inscriptions of this king. Nevertheless, circumstantial evidence allows us to conclude that three new provinces were created in the west in Shalmaneser's reign: Samaria, the southern part of the kingdom of Israel, and Sam'alla and Que in the region of Adana in south-eastern Turkey.

    *This bronze weight in the shape of a lion was found at Kalhu as part of a set of different sizes, ranging from 2 cm to 30 cm in length. Our example measures 28.5 cm and weighs 15 kg. This corresponds  to "fifteen royal mina", as the Aramaic inscription engraved on the lion  and indicating its weight has it. There is a connection between the  weight's shape of a lion, the royal animal, and the fact that it was  used to measure units of weight according to the royal standard, which  is twice that of the the regular standard; the latter was usually  measured using weights in the shape of ducks.

    However, in 722 BC, Sargon replaced his brother Shalmaneser as king of Assyria amidst murky but decidedly violent circumstances. Shalmaneser's fate is unknown but that the succession was awkward is plainly indicated by the fact that Sargon's voluminous body of royal inscriptions contains just one reference to his predecessor: in it, Sargon has his brother condemned as a godless tyrant who had robbed the city of Assur of its traditional privileges. One can safely assume that unless Shalmaneser managed to flee to one of Assyria's enemy states and found asylum there (for which there is no indication at all), he met his death in the struggle for the kingship of Assyria.
    
    ### **Queen Banitu**
    
    While her husband's last resting place is not known, the burial of Shalmaneser's wife and queen, Banitu, has been located in the Northwest Palace at Kalhu. However, a mystery remains. Some of her grave goods (a golden wine bowl and an electron cosmetics container) were discovered in 1988 in the tomb, and even the sarcophagus, of Tiglath-pileser's queen Yaba (Tomb 2); they can be identified by their inscriptions: "Belonging to Banitu, queen of Shalmaneser, king of Assyria". However, there is a problem with matching the bodies in this grave with the number of known occupants: there are too few skeletons. According to their inscriptions, there are grave goods belonging to three queens: Yaba queen of Tiglath-pileser, Banitu queen of Shalmaneser and Atalia queen of Sargon II, while the sarcophagus contains the remains of only two bodies. The one at the bottom of the coffin is surely that of Yaba and the one laid to rest on top of her is likely to be Atalia - but where is Banitu?
    
    It is of course possible that Sargon's queen Atalia inherited some possessions from her predecessor Banitu and was buried with them. But there may be another, more intriguing, solution to the puzzle. The names of both queen Yaba (West Semitic) and queen Banitu (Akkadian) mean "the beautiful one", and they may indeed have been the same person, a hypothesis strengthened by two facts: firstly, Naqia, the famous mother of king Esarhaddon (681-669 BC), was also known under the Akkadian version of her West Semitic name, Zakutu; and secondly, Shalmaneser III is certain to have taken the last wife of his father Assurnasirpal II (883-859 BC) in marriage in the course of his ascension to the throne. If the assumption that Yaba, queen of Tiglath-pileser, and Banitu, queen of Shalmaneser, are one and the same person is correct then Shalmaneser V, too, would have married his father's widow - who would certainly not have been his own mother but another, perhaps younger, wife of the king (the remains have been identified as belonging to a woman of about 30-35 years of age) - in an attempt to further secure the succession: an old and tested strategy but one that ultimately proved to have been in vain in this particular case.

    # **Week 3 - A Visit to the Head Office: The Royal Capital and Court**
    
    ## Key Theme: The Royal Capital and Court
    
    Until 879 BC, the city of Assur was the heart of Assyria in every way, and therefore, also the home of the king's main residence. Ever since Aššur-uballiṭ had proclaimed himself king in the 14th century BC, the palace, ēkallu in Assyrian, from the ancient Sumerian word for, “big house”, served as the centre of government. But in 879, King Ashurnasirpal II transferred the court to a new location. And Assur was stripped in one sweep of its function as the seat of royal power and as the hub of the state administration. We've previously linked the move away from Assur to the drastic change in the character of Assyrian kingship that took the ruler unambiguously out of the shadow of the god Aššur. Now I want to stress that Kalḫu, modern Nimrud, the new capital city, was a good choice because it was much more conveniently located than Assur.
    
    It is of key importance where in a state its centre is situated. Until the invention of telegraphy in the 19th century AD, all complex information had to travel physically, whether by letter or by envoy. Easy communication surely facilitates the cohesion of large states. There's an obvious advantage to a capital that is well-connected to the rest of the state, as it serves as the hub of state communication, as the most important meeting place for the king with his subjects and allies, and as the destination for taxes and tribute from across the realm. But as the kingdom of Assyria expanded, its traditional capital city of Assur occupied an increasingly peripheral position in the kingdom.
    
    ![Untitled](Organizing%20an%20Empire%2081a77c1360bd4f7cbbb1170f7f1e274c/Untitled%2012.png)
    
    Assur is situated on the western bank of the Tigris River, while the rest of the Assyrian heartland lies on the eastern bank. West of Assur lies the steppe region, with very few permanent settlements. And traversing the steppe to reach the Assyrian holdings on the Khabur River was not an easy journey.
    
    The most important east-west overland route, ran along the southern fringes of Taurus Mountains and connected the Mediterranean coast with Iran. Both Nineveh, (modern Mosul) and Arbela, (modern Erbil) are situated on that route, but Assur was far away from it. The new capital city, Kalḫu, was a much better choice in this regard. Situated some 70km north of Assur on the eastern bank of the Tigris, it lies close to the prominent east-west route at an important intersection of the inter-regional road network. The ancient city was completely transformed to fit its new purpose as the stage on which the king and the empire were presented and celebrated.
    
    The roots of the settlement went back 5000 years when it was first occupied during the Neolithic period like so many other places in the fertile fringes of the Taurus and the Zagros mountains. By the ninth century BC, the settlement mount had grown to a substantial height. This is due to the typical building style with mud brick. Where old houses were simply leveled to give way to new buildings that were built on top of the ruins. Over the decades, centuries and millennia, the settlement rises higher and higher until it appears as a mount in the landscape.
    
    The old settlement mount of Kalḫu, was now turned into a fortified citadel that housed only the royal palace and shrines for the most important deities of the Assyria such as Ištar, Ninurta and Nabû. But no temple Aššur whose only sanctuary remained in the city of Assur. The citadel occupied only a small part in a corner of the much larger city. With a size of 360 hectares, Ashurnasirpal’s Kalḫu covered twice the ground of Assur and was surrounded by a long city wall with a length of seven and a half kilometres. From a contemporary perspective, this city was gigantic.
    
    Now, it needed to filled with inhabitants. The king appointed his palace overseer, Nergal-apil-kūmū’a by edict to oversee this task. And this man hand-picked residents for the new imperial centre from all over the kingdom. We can certainly assume that only those who had shown enthusiasm for the king and his plans for the Assyrian state were chosen. Therefore, it was not merely a new political centre that was created in 879 BC, but one that was populated with loyal supporters of king and empire.
    
    The most impressive building at Kalḫu was, Ashurnasirpal’s palace. With a length of 200 meters and the width of 130 meters, it dominates its surroundings. Situated on top of citadel, it is visible from afar, and stood as a monument to the new found prominence and assertiveness of Assyrian kingship. The palace was organised in three distinct areas arranged around three courtyards: the state department where the king met with his court and his visitors. the administrative wing where the palace's income and business affairs were managed. and the private quarters that housed the royal family. Itself in many ways a novel form of architecture that combined structural and decorative elements from all over the empire, it served as the definitive model for the palaces constructed by all later Assyrian kings. It also served as the model for the palaces erected in all provincial capitals. These buildings were called palace, ēkallu, just like the main residence, and the king was seen as their master and owner. When the king traveled he would stay there, but usually these provincial palaces were occupied only by the governors who ruled on the king's behalf.
    
    This was part of the key strategy of Assyrian governance to ensure that the regional managers, the governors, had very little opportunity to develop a visible identity apart from that as the caretaker of the king. We will return to this in Module Four.
    
    It was always an honour to meet the king. Whoever desired to see him had to apply for an audience and wait until it was granted. Access to the palace and its various quarters was strictly controlled by protocol and various means of security. **The king usually met with his visitors in the throne room where he sat elevated on top of a pedestal on the high chair with his feet on a footstool so that the caller effectively faced the royal toes when standing in front of the king. This at least made “kissing the king's feet”, so an expression of paying homage to the ruler, much easier.**
    
    But while protocol heavily shaped royal encounter, the king was keen to meet with his people in ways that reinforced feelings of group identity and togetherness, while highlighting his superior position. The royal banquet was a key instrument in this. F**or visitors, the honour of eating and drinking with the king not only brought the pleasure of dining exquisitely and drinking the finest wines. An invitation to a banquet with the king also had a material, lasting component, as one was presented with the dinnerware as a farewell gift. Its material was an indication of one's social standing. Gold for royalty, then silver, bronze and fine pottery. No wonder that such dishes often accompanied their proud owners into the grave.** The concern for limited and controlled access is already reflected in the very architecture of the palace. It is separated architecturally from the rest of the city. It could not be overlooked from the outside. And it had few and easily controllable entrances, both from the outside and between the different palace quarters. Gatekeepers controlled gateways and doors and whenever deemed necessary, these were equipped with bolts and locks.
    
    ![Untitled](Organizing%20an%20Empire%2081a77c1360bd4f7cbbb1170f7f1e274c/Untitled%2013.png)
    
    In addition to such protection, entrances were also secured by supernatural means. All major entrances of the palace were furnished with monumental images of protective deities. And underneath the thresholds, small statuettes of protective spirits or dogs were buried sometimes inscribed with short prayers. Together with the execution of the appropriate rituals, these representations were thought to offer potent protection against malevolent forces of all kinds, including human intruders.
    
    ![Untitled](Organizing%20an%20Empire%2081a77c1360bd4f7cbbb1170f7f1e274c/Untitled%2014.png)
    
    Lucky were those whose link with the king were so close that they could hope to bypass all these layers of protection easily and have free access to the king. These royal companions held an honorary title that literally means, “he who is close”, and were at the very top of the court hierarchy. Enjoying the king's confidence and trust, they were his preferred choice of envoy.
    
    Many of them had a military background, highlighting how much of his time the Assyrian king spent with the army, and what a comparatively good opportunity the military campaigns and camp life provided for getting to know the ruler. **Although the palace at Kalḫu was enormous, it effectively served as the home of only one family, albeit an unusual one. As the continuation of the royal bloodline was paramount, the king only had only one queen, but many wives, and all their children were his legitimate offspring. This sets the royal family apart from the otherwise monogamous Assyrian society. In 879 BC, not only was the extended royal family relocated, but the entire royal court, which meant moving hundreds of people from Assur to Kalḫu**. Trusted **Nergal-apil-kūmū’a**, also took care of this task. And this was presumably no less challenging than selecting inhabitants for the rest of the city.
    
    The new palace was much larger than the old palace in Assur and much more elaborately constructed and decorated. It was a much improved version in every way, but one.
    
    The old palace in Assur served as the burial place of the Assyrian rulers, mirroring also the practices of other Assyrians who too buried their dead underneath the family home. When the royal court moved, the old palace in Assur did not lose this function. Even Ashurnasirpal himself was buried in the ancient warrens of tombs beneath the palace at Assur. And his successors continued to use it as their final resting place. In 1989, just before the second Gulf War, the Iraqi State Department of Antiquities made a sensational discovery when its archaeologists found several underground tombs beneath the private quarters of Ashurnasirpal’s palace in Kalḫu. These turned out to house the burials of royal women and children. One of the tombs was the last resting place of Ashurnasirpal's queen, a woman with the long name, Mullissu-mukannišat-Ninua. The means, “the goddess Mulissu is the one who brings together the people of the city of Nineveh”.
    
    Her burial inscription identifies her as the daughter of the king's cup bearer, one of the most prominent courtiers. Unfortunately, we don't know whether he held the function because he was the king's father-in-law, or whether the king married his daughter because of his prominence in the realm. Mullissu-mukannisat-Ninua and the other loyal women were buried with rich grave goods, with golden jewellery and dinnerware and richly coloured garments made out of exotic materials like silk and cotton. They give a vivid impression of the luxury in which the king and his entourage lived at court. While all well-to-do Assyrians had slaves living with them in their family home, some times even a few dozens, the loyal court housed several hundreds of people who served the king and his family as retainers, guards, scribes, scholars, cooks, bakers, pastry makers, dancers, musicians and so forth. Not all of them were slaves either. Being a member of court was a great honour and Assyrian families sent their sons to enter the palace. Crucially, those who entered the palace were made eunuchs, and we'll discuss the benefits of this to the king, in Module Four. The palace overseer, Nergal-apil-kūmū’a, who oversaw the move from Assur to Kalḫu, was one of these royal eunuchs. But not all courtiers were castrated, as there were also many “bearded ones” at court. Some of these were the sons of foreign rulers or other nobles, who either were placed in the Assyrian king's care as part of an alliance, or had been captured in battle.
    
    These hostages lived as honoured members of the court. At least some were sent back to their home countries where they were expected to act in the Assyria interest when they assumed positions of power.
    
    We may see this as a cynical exploitation of Stockholm Syndrome, but on the whole, this strategy worked very well and constituted an important element in keeping the neighbouring state in line as co-operative parts of the empire.
    
    ## Talking About Family Life, Part 1
    
    So today we're going to be talking a lot about family life and my first question - very basic. Karen, please tell me how do ordinary people live in ancient Assyria? >> Denise, it's [LAUGH] again one of your trick questions. >> [LAUGH] >> Well I can tell you in quite a lot of detail how people live in cities, but really we don't know as much about how people would live in the countryside. We've discussed already at some point, the fact that very, very many people would been farmers. But we have so far, not managed to excavate a village, a farmstead. So that makes it quite difficult to reimagine how a farmer's family would have looked like, would have lived like. What we do have in great numbers are documents and archeological excavations that illustrate how people lived in the cities, in the medium to large cities. Especially in the heartland in Northern Iraq, but also in provincial centres. And we can talk about that. [LAUGH] >> [LAUGH] >> But we must be clear on the fact that lifestyles of people in the countryside would be quite different for sure. >> So when we talk about the people in the cities what percentage of the population are we actually describing then? >> Again really, really difficult to say. >> Yeah. >> It's clear that part of the Assyrian Empire strategy was to, on the whole settle as many people as they could in large settlements, in large cities. And not necessarily completely destroy a village lifestyle, but on the whole “enable” or force people to live in cities. These communities are just much easier to organise from a state perspective when you think about taxation, conscription, so that's public work and so and so forth. So on the whole, this is in motion, it's hard enough to give a percentage number for a given time, not to say it's largely impossible, but on the whole, we have to say that this is a strategy that over the 300 years that we know quite well would have come into force more and more. And that in the 9th century a larger percentage of people would have been living in rural contexts than at the end of the 7th century. >> Right. >> Especially in the heartland, so urbanism comes more and more into force. So in especially in the heartland in Northern Iraq, which we understand quite well, we have more and more big cities where people live in very, very, very good living conditions. And they of course, profit very much from empire, so to say. And about these people, I can tell you a great deal. >> Okay, well in that case, recognising that we're talking much more about an urban experience than an agricultural experience. Can you paint me a picture of what an Assyrian house looks like? >> [LAUGH] >> [LAUGH] >> I can, I can. >> Of course, you can. [LAUGH] >> I've worked on excavations in several sites where we were excavating houses. One of them was in the city of Assur and the other one was in the city of Dur-Katlimmu what is known today as Syria. And the houses that we've unearthed there were very, very different in size, but the basic components are the same. And so I'll discuss this with you, and then we’ll talk about size and scale, okay? >> Okay. >> So the basic Assyrian house is organised around the courtyard. So the courtyard is very, very important, a lot of activities were taking place in the courtyard including cooking, baking, making textiles, washing; all these would happen in the courtyard. And the courtyard would be inside the house. So that's quite different from a set up where you've got a house and sort of a yard or a back garden. >> A yard, which is public. >> Yeah, or at least people can see- >> Yes. >> into that yard. So the life in the courtyard is very private.
    
    Play video starting at :5:11 and follow transcript5:11
    
    So depending on how big the house is, an Assyrian house might have several courtyards. But certain activities would definitely always take place in these courtyards as we already said. That has to do with the fact that Assyrian houses didn't have windows, because there's no glass, or at least there's no sheet glass, so you don't have windows at all. And everything that needs a light needs to happen outdoors basically. And Assyrian houses can have an upper floor, but typically would be one floor only. And if there is an upper floor, it would be only in parts of the house. Okay, so the house would have one entrance that leads then quickly into this courtyard and various rooms organised in suites would be accessible from that courtyard. And some of them would be more public than others. What would be completely private really would be the rooms where the people would sleep. These rooms would typically have bathrooms attached to them. >> [LAUGH] wonderful. >> because Assyrians are very, very clean people. Assyrian houses are very, very well provided with running water, with indoor plumbing, if you will. They would typically have a well, they would have a sewage system. And you would take baths; you would wash yourself in you own house. That's not a given, at all, in antiquity. A lot of ancient civilisations had public baths. Roman civilisation- >> Yes. >> For example. A lot happened in these public baths. The Assyrians didn't have public baths, they washed at home, okay? So the bedroom typically has this bathroom attached, and that's of course private. You wouldn't bring a visiting neighbour, or whatever, into your bedroom. You would admit them in the courtyard or in a living room.
    
    Play video starting at :7:33 and follow transcript7:33
    
    And that room would be quite close to the entrance to the house, of course. We've already said that windows do not exist at that time, not just in Assyria but nowhere. What you would have would be openings at the top of the wall just below the ceiling and light would come in there. But on the wall indoors you'd have sort of quite dark shaded atmosphere, which is good in regions where typically it's quite hot. And as we said in the Assyrian heartland, we have these tough winters. And then again you'll be grateful for your well-insulated architecture. Houses would, of course, be built from mud brick. So clay with straw - you put that in moulds and you make bricks, which for private architecture, you wouldn't fire because it's just a waste of energy, waste of firing material. You'd use the unbaked mud bricks, and that means that the lifespan of such a building wouldn't be awfully long. We would talk about 50 years, 60 years, something like that. So every two generations, or so you would have to rebuild the house. Or either way, rebuilding the house, renovating the house is just something that happens all the time. Which is very good for archeology, because then we can sort of get the sequence and so on. Quite a lot of rubbish gets trapped between the old floor and the new floor that one just puts on top of the old floor. So everything is basically made out of clay, except for the roof, for which you would need timber. You need roof beams: the roofs are flat and you put timber on top of your walls and then cover that with branches, reeds, and so on. It has to be replaced also periodically. And the doors would also be made from wood. So those would be the most expensive parts of the house, and when you sold the house or when you bought a house. You would get of course a sale document, a deed, and that would then specify that you've bought the house including it's door and it's roof beams. >> [LAUGH] >> If it didn't say that then the people when they moved out would take those with them. Okay, so one thing I have yet to mention and it's one of the things that strike us perhaps as bizarre.

    People would bury their dead, if they could, inside their houses, in one of the most private rooms, a living room that was used only by the family. That room would be called the “strong room”, and that room would then have an underground tomb, accessible through a trap door. And whenever someone died, they would open that tomb, and place the dead person there. >> So would they treat the dead person before? Or would they live with the smell of rotting corpse? >> [LAUGH] >> Or would they desiccate it- >> [LAUGH] >> In the desert that I keep imagining that the entire- [LAUGH] >> Forget your desert. >> Yes. [LAUGH] >> That is another tricky question - difficult to answer. The best data we have are from the city of Assur, but from excavations that took place 100 years ago >> Okay. >> and the bones weren't kept. So there is more recent evidence, especially from a not-private funeral at all, but from royal burials. And from one body in particular, it's clear that it was treated in some way. >> Right. >> That the body was exposed to higher temperatures, possibly boiled. Because of course you're right - that would be quite a problem. But we don't know much about how the Assyrians treated their dead before they put them in sarcophagi under ground. >> Yeah. >> We don't know, this is not Egypt where we have so much information about funerary culture. So I can't really answer apart from saying that people were typically buried with the body intact. The body would have been put into a sarcophagus that could be, depending on social standing, that could be made out of stone that would be of course very expensive, metal. And then these sarcophagi look like bathtubs, that's why they're called bathtub sarcophagi. >> [LAUGH]. >> Indeed, a big discussion whether those are recycled bathtubs. >> Interesting, yeah. >> And but you could also bury people individually and not put them in a tomb all together. But you would still prefer to bury them underneath the floor of your house, in the courtyard. The graves then wouldn't be very deep, so the idea is to put the body into a vessel of some sort and keep it close. >> Yes, this is so interesting.
    
    ## Talking About Family Life, Part 2
    
    Okay, well moving from the structure of the house to the actual inhabitants, the living inhabitants in this case. What kind of a family set-up would an urban Assyrian typically have? >> Okay. >> If you can describe that for me, please. >> Yeah, well from the fact that people like to bury their dead inside their houses it's clear that typically, if people could, they would live for generations in the same house. And the house would be passed on typically to the eldest son and his family. And so the typical setup would be that one family occupies one house, and it's not just the dead that would be there, but several generations. >> Okay. >> Several generations, dead and alive [LAUGH] >> [LAUGH] >> would share the house. >> Indeed. >> Yeah, that's the basic setup, the children of this family would live with their parents not just until they reached adulthood, but sometimes much longer. They would typically only move out when they got married.

    Girls for sure and also boys, unless they are the eldest son. And so typically, we know a lot about these multi-generational families through the main line. And whoever moves out, sort of gets lost to us, in a way. And again, we can link that of course to the growing Assyrian Empire.

    People that didn't come into the possession of their paternal home, they also have to live somewhere. We can say that in the city of Assur which is so very well explored, we can say that on the whole houses tended to be left intact, that means they were not divided. That did happen sometimes, but the basic idea was clearly to leave the house intact. >> Okay. >> So that means some members of the family definitely moved out. Because otherwise- >> Yes. >> of course, we would- >> have a problem very quickly. So it's basically one house for one family, and that family typically consisted of a couple and their children, and the mother of the husband. >> Right, okay. >> Not typically the father of the husband, because he would be dead before the son married. Because there's a link in Assyria between coming into your inheritance, and getting married, if you are a man. >> Can you give me a sense of what that means - what age sons can typically, expect to marry?
    
    Play video starting at :3:11 and follow transcript3:11
    
    >> Yeah, that's linked to the age when their father dies. >> Okay. >> The father dies and the son would come into his inheritance, and that would be the time that he would get married. We know quite a bit about Assyrian life expectancy. Men would live to an age of 50, 55, 60. That wouldn't be unusual at all. When the father dies the son would get his inheritance as would his younger brothers, and that's then typically when they would get married. So we're talking really about someone who would be in their late 20s, around 30, just like their fathers before them. But the bride the son would choose as his wife would be much, much, much younger. He would choose a girl that would have just entered adulthood. So basically, we are talking about a young woman who was just old enough really to carry a pregnancy to term and to give birth without dying. And so we are talking about someone who is probably 13, 14 years old, with a husband who is as we said late 20s, early 30s. >> Early 30s. >> So someone that is at least twice the girl’s age, so that's typical of the Assyrian family set-up. And that set-up makes then the most of a woman's childbearing years. Then if she survived this, then of course, she could outlive her husband for a number of years. So frequently, we have a household set-up where we have the grown up husband who'd come into his inheritance with his wife, who was let's say 15 years younger than him, their had children and his mother, his widowed mother, living with them. Whereas the wife would have left her family behind when she got married. Mind you, they might very well live in the same city. But legally speaking when a woman gets married, when a girl gets married, she receives her share of the family estate, not in the form of inheritance, she doesn't have to wait until the father dies. She gets her share as her dowry, at the moment when she gets married. She brings that with her when she gets married, and should she get divorced, she would take that with her again, but we'll talk about that at another time >> when we talk about women and women's lives. So we will also have the children of that couple, boys and girls. They would leave the household at very different moments in their life, as we said. The girls when they got married in their early teens, the boys after their father in turn would die. And when the father died, the brothers could either choose to divide the inheritance, which would mean that the oldest brother would typically get the house, would stay living in that house - the house with all the ancestors buried underneath the floors. Whereas the brothers would move out, would find another house, maybe the same city, maybe somewhere else. Quite often, we really don't know the details. Or the brothers might decide not to split the inheritance, but keep living together. The younger brothers might still choose to get married, but they would then basically live in the same household as the brother, until a point in time where they might set up their own household. And sometimes we can then see adaptations in the physical fabric of the house that shows that parts were sort of separated a little bit. But this family wouldn't be the only people living in our house, because Assyrians, especially wealthy Assyrians, had slaves. >> Okay. >> Yeah, and the slaves would be living in that same house with the family.
    
    Play video starting at :8: and follow transcript8:00
    
    Some of these slaves could have been bought, because there was a trade in slaves. Prisoners of war could be sold as slaves, exotic foreigners were popular as slaves for well to do families, especially from Anatolia, for whatever reasons- from modern day Turkey. And that's one way of entering a household as a slave. But many families never bought slaves and still the had them because slaves, of course, were born into the family. And the third source of slaves, were Assyrians that fell onto hard times. If you couldn't pay your debts, you could sell yourself into slavery, typically with your creditor, or you could place your children into debt slavery. The idea was that you could redeem yourself and your family members. But that from the start would always have been an uphill struggle, because once you were in these desperate straits, how could you realistically hope to do that? On the whole this doesn't happen very often in well-to-do central Assyria in the heartland, which of course profits enormously from the expansion of the Assyrian Empire. And on the whole we have very well-to-do people that we are dealing with there, but this is legally possible. But however you look at that, the most usual set up would be that slaves in a family would have been born into that family.
    
    Play video starting at :9:49 and follow transcript9:49
    
    And that of course means, that really we are talking people that are related to each other. >> Right. >> Because the slave women giving birth to slave children, would give birth to children typically fathered by male members of the family, the main family. >> By the family members not necessarily by other slaves. >> Yeah, no, no, that's the idea, although it's also possible that slaves are married to other slaves, that does happen as well. But on the whole, we are talking really about the male members of the main family fathering children with the slave women, Who may have been their cousins, great cousins, whatever. And there would have been a great awareness of this of course. But there is a big legal and social distinction, because only the children born to the legal wife would have been entitled to inherit or receive a dowry. So we're talking, on the one hand, about a largely monogamous society. But that's only true as long as we consider marriage the way the Assyrians do, which is connected to inheritance and property, and not about relationships that also lead to children, children that live with the family, but are not at all seen as legal members of that family that are due a share, whether they are boys or girls. And of course, that's the reason why people wouldn't necessarily sell their slaves, unless they had a particular reason to doing that. Because in a way those were their relatives and they were very aware of that. And a lot to do with adoption and so on and so forth, plays with these… not necessarily completely black and white boundaries between being a slave and being a legitimate family member. So where were we? We've been talking about our houses in the centre. I did say that there were wide differences in the size of these houses. >> Yes. >> I said that houses in Assur were of a completely different scale than the houses in this place Dur-Katlimmu in the provinces. And that surely has to do with the fact that if you wanted to further your fortunes, you had very good opportunities to do that once you left the Assyrian heartland in Northern Iraq, and went elsewhere as part of this imperial project. And at Dur-Katlimmu, we excavated a house, one family's house, and the house was gigantic. It was very palatial- >> [LAUGH] Not compared to the Assyrian palace, mind you. But really much, much larger that anything the ordinary person in Assur would live in. And and these people, as we said, have a very high standard of living. We're talking about several hundreds of square metres on the first floor only. >> Wow, yeah. >> And that family, they bought lots of slaves, because this was a new house; a new household was being created. And when you sort of start from scratch, then of course, you're in a very different situation than when you live in an established household. >> Okay, well that's a lot of meaty stuff. So one last question as always, bringing this back to the head of Assyria.

    What you have just described, how does that relate to the royal family? What are the differences and what are the things that are the same? >> Well there are many, many, many similarities really. On the whole one can say that the Assyrian royal family doesn't function very differently from the urban, well to do Assyrian family that we've described. It's also all about inheritance, it's also all about insuring that the family continues across generations. They too, buried their dead >> underneath the floor in the palace. But because this generational continuity is so much more in the royal family, there are some differences there. So while the…

    while the average Assyrian man was in a monogamous marriage, and had only children, legally “seen” children, with this one spouse. The Assyrian king couldn't afford to do that. Because what if there was a problem with having children? This is one of the foremost duties of the king is really to procreate. So this risk couldn't be taken, and therefore the Assyrian king had several legally binding marriages. That was also important of course, in terms of international relations - treaties with other states, very, very often, and actually typically, including a dynastic marriage. So the king would be married to the daughter of a client king. So the king would have several wives. Only one of them would be considered the queen. But not only the children with that particular queen would be possible successors. >> So could the king have an unlimited number of wives or was there a typical number? >> No, no, in a sense. So what's crucial is this idea of monogamy was so important that the king followed it. So the king only had one queen. >> Yes, yes. >> The king had several partners, if you will, but they didn't have this title. There was only ever one queen, and the royal blood, if you will, that went from the king to his heirs, to his sons. And therefore, it's very, very important to guarantee that they are really the king's sons. And we can talk that some more when we talk about eunuchs, which will be our next topic. I look forward to that one. Of course.

# Week 5

**Key Theme: Making Assyrians**

We have discussed the fact that the Assyrian Empire consisted on the one hand of the provinces that made up the kingdom of Assyria, and on the other hand of the client-states whose governments accepted the sovereignty of the Assyrian King.

But while the people in all these regions were subject of the Assyrian empire, only the inhabitants of the provinces, only the people under the authority of a provincial governor appointed by the Assyrian King, were considered to be Assyrians.

So what does it mean to be Assyrian? From the perspective of the god Aššur and his temple at the city of Assur, the answer to that question was straightforward. An Assyrian was a person who accepted the authority of the god Aššur. An Assyrian was a servant of the god Aššur and the servant of Aššur participated in the feast of Aššur. There were two aspect to this. Firstly, it was duty and the privilege of the servants of Aššur to provide their god with regular sacrifices. Some of these were presented to him in the form of a daily feast. It was prepared and presented by the staff of his temple in Assur. You will remember that the only shrine for the god was situated in the city that shared his name. The core ingredients of Aššur’s feast were beef, mutton, and poultry, cereals like barley and wheat, sesame oil, honey, and seasonal fruits such as apples and figs. These ingredients were not especially rare, and had originally been procured locally at Assur. But as the city-state of Assur turned into the kingdom of Assyria, the ingredients were no longer sourced merely in the city of Assur. Instead, they had to be delivered from all across the realm in relatively small quantities, but regularly, and as Assyria expanded, over ever increasing distances. The provincial governors who were in charge of organising taxation and conscription also had the duty to provide ingredients for the feast of Aššur on behalf of their subjects. Every province had to participate in filling Aššur’s table.

The message was clear, all servants of Aššur, all Assyrians had to join in the care for the god. In this way, the Assyrian state can be defined as the community of Aššur’s worshippers. At Assur, the temple's butchers, bakers, confectioners, brewers, and oil pressers, all of them men, processed the materials and prepared the dishes. In a cultural context where the ritual preparation and celebration of a daily feast in honour of the god was at the core of temple worship these culinary specialists were naturally among the priestly personnel. Once prepared, the dishes were brought into the presence of the statue of the god. Awakened by the so-called mouth opening ritual, the statue was thought to be sentient and appreciative of the music and the prayers, the incense and the flowers that accompanied the serving of the food. Gods were thought to consume their meal by absorbing its essence by smell. So to the modern observer, the leftovers of Aššur’s feast would have appeared as the untouched dishes, intact, but cooled down.

Participation in Aššur’s feast was more than providing ingredients. The second equally important aspect was the consumption of these leftovers. As once the dishes had been removed from the offering tables, they were distributed back into the community. A strict protocol governed who receive which parts of the leftovers. The least of recipients included the staff of Aššur’s temple, but also the king, and his court, and the “great ones” of Assyria, the state officials placed across the realm.

In order to reach the provincial governors, the dishes had to be transported over considerable distances just like before the ingredients from which they had been prepared. After the move of the royal court away from Assur in 879 BC, also the shares for the king and his courtiers had to be sent to that distant destination. The food was of course no longer fresh when it reached the recipients. But to eat from the divine feast was not meant to be a culinary experience, but a blessing. “Whoever eats the leftovers will live” as a royal official put it in the seventh century BC. Partaking in Aššur’s meal in this manner was a huge privilege and bound the Assyrian officials together, and to the god, no matter how far away from his temple they were based.

In addition, when the governors ate the leftovers, they consumed them on behalf of the inhabitants of their provinces. By contributing ingredients to the daily feast of Aššur, and by consuming directly or indirectly its leftovers, all subjects of the Assyrian state, the land of the god Aššur, were envisaged as the congregation of Aššur, whose contribution to his worship was their privilege and duty. In essence, this is what it meant to be an Assyrian.

However, from the viewpoint of the crown, contributing to the feast of Aššur was merely one component of the participation required of the people of the land of Aššur. In the imperial period, the offerings to the feast of Aššur were seen as part of the much larger tax burden levied on all inhabitants of his realm by the king.

This is made explicit, for example, in this passage of an inscription of King Tiglath-pileser III describing what happened after he conquered the parts of northern Babylonia in 745 BC. “I annexed these regions to the land of Assur, and placed one of my eunuchs as governor over them. From their taxes, which I take annually, I apportioned 240 sheep to the god Aššur, my lord, as his share. Of those whom I deported, I settled a certain number in location A, another number in location B”, and so forth. Tiglath-pileser's inscription prominently mentions that after the conquered regions were turned into provinces, parts of their population were settled elsewhere in his realm. In this context, people are seen every much as commodities, albeit very precious ones.

Play video starting at :7:2 and follow transcript7:02

We'll discuss the extensive program of deportations that was implemented during the imperial period separately. Tiglath-pileser then goes on to say, “I united these people, I counted them as people of the land of Aššur. And as Assyrians, I impose the yoke of the god Aššur, my lord, upon them.” From the perspective of the Assyrian state administration, to be an Assyrian meant to pay taxes to the Assyrian crown. And to make someone an Assyrian meant imposing debt obligation. **Most importantly, these were taxes on landed property and animal stock, which were paid in kind. And the poll tax, which was originally due in the form of a certain number of days of labor per year for public works or military service. At least by the late eighth century BC, this obligation could also be paid off.**

Taxes were due by the head of a family on behalf of the entire household. It is essential to stress that in the imperial period, the requirements to contribute to the worship of Aššur were seen as a small part of the overall tax obligation. The governors, whose main responsibility was to oversee the collection of taxes in their provinces, were held responsible to supply what was due to Aššur.

Although the contribution to Aššur’s worship is at the root of the Assyrian state taxation, by the imperial period this obligation was disconnected from the dues of the individual tax payer. While membership of Aššur’s congregation was a very real thing for all those running the empire, who not only contributed to the offerings, but also consumed the leftovers of the meal, the cult of Aššur was otherwise a step removed from the inhabitants of Assyria. The exceptions are of course the residents of the city of Assur, who were intimately concerned with the deity. They'd choose names that offered praise or prayer to the gods, such as Aššur-remanni or “Aššur, have mercy on me”, or Aššur-duri, “Aššur is my fortress”. And the other cities of the realm, the personal relationships expressed in such names were reserved for local deities, but not Aššur. The religious dimension in justifying Assyrian taxation never amounted to a movement to proselytise the cult of Aššur. To be Assyrian, it was sufficient to accept the uncontested authority of the Assyrian King. By the imperial period, we need not to trace one's lineage to the ancient families of the city of Assur to be Assyrian. We need not to speak the Assyrian language.

In essence to be Assyrian was to pay taxes to the king, Aššur’s representative on Earth.

And when the king turned conquered people into Assyrians, he imposed that obligation onto them. **Adding people to the realm created Assyrians, and these can be described as the most important product of the imperial project. They were participants, commodities, and consumers of all the empire could offer.**

## Talking about Women’s Lives

Okay, well we've mainly talked about women and their roles as mothers, spouses, and daughters. We've emphasised the typically, considerable age difference between a husband and a wife. We said that this would have been about 15 years, typically. We said that if a woman managed to survive her child-bearing years, she could outlive her husband by a considerable span of time. And that means that we are talking about a society where we have young wives, young mothers, lots of widows, relatively speaking. We do have old women, but many, many women would have died fairly young, because bearing children would have been, as it would be today without medical intervention, is a dangerous business. And many women would have died during pregnancy, especially during birth or afterwards, as would have their children. So, child mortality would definitely be a huge factor, shaping Assyrian society, and shaping, especially, women's lives, yeah. So, of course we are talking also about a context where women's fertility would have been prized enormously. This is with a high child mortality. **We are talking of course about a society that needs to produce a greater number of children because many of them would die. And that would mean that a married woman would spend a considerable time of her life being pregnant, yeah.** So that's very far away for us, perhaps, but it's something that would've been recognisable to many people today, of course, to many women today, of course. And, of course, to the generation of our, possibly not grandmothers, but certainly great grandmothers. 

Okay, women's looks would have been shaped a great deal by this, and there's oneset of documents about, it's a slave woman who gets sold twice in her life. Once as a young girl, so young that she is qualified as a girl in contrast to a woman, so she's not yet grown up. And then really only a few years later, she's sold again, and now she is referred to as an old woman. And if you make the calculation, then she can't have been much older than 32, yeah. So that's quite tough, really. So, on the whole, we have to say women's lives peaked early. There was the chance of having a wonderful life as a widow bossing around your young daughter-in-law and, yeah, that's that. But when we talk about women's lives in the family context, then a lot of it would not immediately sound very appealing to women like you and I.

Well if a married woman can't have children, there are several options. This is simply her most important role within the marriage, of course, is to be the mother of the children of her husband. If you can't do that, a lot depends on the social standing of this woman and her family, and the size of her dowry. **The couple can get divorced - both the husband and the wife can initiate a divorce. When that happens, however, the woman would take her dowry back. And if it's the husband who initiates the divorce and if this has been agreed at the time the marriage is made, he might have to double the dowry.** So this is something that, of course, becomes much much more important, the wealthier the partners are; this might not have been a huge concern in a relatively modest household. But if we're talking about our wealthy, urban families, this would have stopped people from getting divorced even if they can't naturally have children. There is adoption in Assyria. And we've already talked about the fact that a wealthy household would typically have all these slaves living with them. And we said that really, the likelihood that the slaves are blood relatives is very high. So, that's an obvious choice of child to adopt then. Adoption required the okay of the wife, that's very important.

The other way of doing it would be to go for a birth mother, who then is required to give up the child once it's born, and declare that child legally the wife's child, yeah. So that's a very modern concept, very modern really. So that again, requires the explicit okay of the wife and it's the wife who typically can select the birth mother. And there are parallels for this, in the Bible, for example. So, again this is really nothing that is specifically Assyrian. That's, in a way, the product of a wealthy society where it's very important to be able to pass on inheritance in a family and where you try to keep the wealth of the family intact. So you don't want to sort of give it up to an outsider; you want to, if it's not your own child, you want to at least be able to shape that child's childhood, and their growing up, and make that child as much your own as you can. And again, the role of the wife is very, very important here, yeah. So that's basically the scenario when it comes to infertility in a married woman.

**In an unmarried woman, depending on her social status, you wouldn't even know about it, because an unmarried Assyrian woman was not meant to have children or have sex, let's put it like that. And in a slave woman, it would probably be quite unwelcome. Because we are talking, of course about pre-industrial society where every pair of hands is wealth. There is no greater factor to work and to labour than human labour at that time.** So, being an infertile woman in Assyrian times would not have been great at all. And depending on one's social status, that would have been mitigated by one's personal wealth and one's family's wealth. So it could be remedied. 

What's the story with single women in ancient Assyria? Well again, of course we are talking about this context of the urban wealthy families, in a way. Slaves could get married with the permission of their owner but typically were not, because it just makes everything more complicated. So we are really talking about these women that are part of an urban family with some income. So there are definitely women who are not married, but who have children And who sort of live with their father's household or with their brother's household and whose children or who's child then also falls under the authority of that woman's birth family. We don't know very much about such scenarios. What we do know is largely from legal documents, when the family for whatever reason, gives up the child. We don't have very many texts that document it, it's a legal affair, and therefore Assyrians write contracts on clay tablets. And those are the sources I'm referring to. So we don't have very many contracts where a family gives up a child. That happens very rarely because they are, as I said, they are good value.

Okay, so, but it does happen and among these not very many cases, a high proportion concerns children of women that are called “**ḫarimtu**” and it's the big question is how to translate this word. Traditionally this word has been translated as “prostitutes” but it has also been suggested that means “unmarried woman”, “unmarried woman who still has a child”. And it, of course, shifts the meaning and the context of what is going on here dramatically.

**Typically, when a child of such a ḫarimtu woman is given up, then the father or her brothers give up the child to a temple.** And that's a particular scenario of course, and it suggests on the one hand, that it's seen as an act of worship because you've gave a family member up to be part of the temple household. So you don’t… you don't put them out of the city and hope that they die. No, that's not what you do; you try to care for them, but you still don't want them with you. So it's tricky. So, in a way, who might be the father of such a child? How would the ḫarimtu, the single woman, have come to bear a child?

Is this shameful to the family, to her or not? That’s quite tricky. The whole issue is made much more complicated because the Greek historian Herodotus wrote in his histories about the custom of temple prostitution in Babylonia, by which he basically means all of the ancient Middle East with a focus on Iraq really. And so that may be linked really to our scenario there, yeah? And he says that it's a custom among the urban families of Babylonia that the women make themselves available at the temple.

And that's where this idea of temple prostitution comes from, and that's what people sort of refer to when they translate this term “ḫarimtu” as prostitute. So it's very, very complicated. It's very clear that we don't really understand much of the roles of women in Assyrian society, who were not married, who did not have this typical career, from daughter to wife to widow. This we sort of understand reasonably well, but everything beyond that, it's very tricky.

Yeah, just like men could enter palace service, so could women. So that women could also enter the palace. And then they wouldn't be administrators or bureaucrats or scribes or something like that. They would provide colour and entertainment in a way to palace life, which you also need of course. So, in palaces we have huge quantities of singers and female musicians who'll seem to live together, so very unclear where they are coming from. Quite often they are grouped in ethnic groups, but in any case these women clearly live outside of a, at least, traditional family context, as part of palace society, of court life.

And that brings us to the royal women of Assyria. In many ways their lives are also mirrored in a way by traditional family life. But they are in various ways different from what we've discussed. **So the royal court had various royal women. Some had borne children who were then daughters and sons of the king. And one of these royal women would be the queen, and only one of them would be the queen as we said, and this queen would be in charge of all the other royal women.** The king's mother could play a particular role, sometimes even overshadowing the role of the queen, but on the whole, the queen was in charge. And the queen did not just lead a social group, but also really a sizable economic part of the palace, because the women of the palace, the royal women didn't sit in the palace and spend their days doing nothing. But they, like women living in other houses, they would have been producing things, most importantly textiles. They would be spinning and weaving, and that would create assets for the household or the palace.

And in the case of the palace, so important was the queen's domain, that she had her own seal in order to authorise what was going on. And that official seal of the queen, which, like the royal seal that we've discussed in another context existed in numerous copies, had an emblem that stood for what the Assyrian queen was. We've already discussed in another context that the Assyrian royal seal showed the king killing a lion, a rampant lion. 

Now the seal of the queen showed a scorpion. **** Does that strike you in any way as strange? Well, I admittedly only see the negative aspect of scorpions. It's like, the queen is poisonous. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's fair enough. **But in Assyria the scorpion, although of course it was a deadly animal, was seen as inherently very positive, because the scorpion, a female scorpion, takes care of its young, of her young I should say. The young scorpion babies sit on the back of the scorpion mother. And the scorpion mother fiercely protects her young with her poisonous sting. And the Assyrians therefore associated with the scorpion the role of the mother who defends her young, yeah, who defends her own.** So basically something that probably you and I might associate with the female lion.

One last question for you - I mean, you have introduced the idea, obviously, of Assyria as being a multicultural place. And I think all of the women that we have talked about so far, the types of women, are all particularly Assyrian women. But what about in other cultural groups in Assyria? >> Yeah, yeah sure, of course. We've talked about the fact that by the time that the Assyrian heartland becomes this multicultural region due to the massive relocation of people from all over the Middle East.

We don't only find traditional Assyrian families in the cities of heartland, but also others. For example, Egyptians. I**n the 670s, the Assyrian King Esarhaddon leads a successful military campaign to Egypt. And that results in the deportation of a great many well-to-do, well-educated Egyptian people, specifically from Memphis. That's in the region of modern-day Cairo. And most of these people were then settled in central Assyria, and we have found their documents, and in some cases even their houses in the cities of Nineveh, and in Assur, again in Assur.** And in Assur, we have family archives that document the lives of these families from the moment that they were settled there. That's in the late 670s til 50 years later, roughly when the Assyrian heartland was conquered when the city of Assur was conquered. Okay, so for about 50 years we've got good information about Egyptian families. And the interesting thing is that they live not in a ghetto, but their houses are in various parts of the city of Assur. And the women of these families are, legally speaking, much more present, much more visible, than their Assyrian counterparts. **Typically in documents you never encounter an Assyrian woman as a witness or as a buyer, as a seller, no, that's always men. When they give up a claim or when they enter an obligation, they have to be represented by a man of their family. Not in these Egyptian families, we see women from these Egyptian families in all these roles. We see them entering various business transactions, we see them in business, we see them in legal proceedings. And that seems to be due to the fact that in Egypt, women have a much greater legal presence than typically in Assyria.** And that apparently doesn't change once these people have been brought into the Assyrian heartland. So that's a very, very important reminder that sometimes our documentation, we've emphasised that on the whole, we are reduced to discussing the affairs of urban well-to-do Assyrians. But sometimes the documentation is quite misleading, because due to the fact that most of these well-to-do families coming from a particular social segment, we don't really see other scenarios. And the Egyptian case is a good reminder that we shouldn't generalise too much. Having said that, the way that the life of these Egyptian women in Assur works is not very different overall from the way that we've discussed it before. It's just their involvement in business affairs, in public life in a way, that is much more visible.

## Focus on Population Management

Human labour is the single most important commodity in the Assyrian Empire, as is of course true for all pre-modern states. Before the advent of machines, all labour had to be done by humans, by animals, or by nature. And in Assyria, human labour is the most important factor. So humans were very, very, very important. And we will focus now on the fact that the Assyrian Empire, in a very invasive way, tried to control and steer where in the realm people settled, where they lived. This concerned millions of people.

![Untitled](Organizing%20an%20Empire%2081a77c1360bd4f7cbbb1170f7f1e274c/Untitled%2016.png)

You see here a table from a book by Bustenay Oded that tries to put together the information that we gained from the written sources. The written sources are, of course, not complete. But he arrives at a very, very high estimated total of 4.4 million people, give or take 900,000, who were resettled in the course of about 250 years. Now, 85% of the documented cases concerned people that were being resettled in central Assyria. We'll look at the map in a moment.

But we have to be aware of the fact that, in antiquity of course, the Middle East would have been far less densely populated than it is now. And while we cannot really put concrete numbers, to the ninth century, the eighth century, the seventh century BC, the periods that we are most concerned with, it is a good mental experiment to assume that for every 100 people that live now in the Middle East, there would only have only been 1. So if we just imagine that there would only have been 1% of the inhabitants that are there now, then we are definitely not far off. And on the whole, this is a high estimate. So therefore, if we talk about 4.4 million people, give or take, being relocated in the span of 250 years. If we convert that to the present day, we would be talking about 44 million people, so gigantic numbers.

**I want you to be very, very aware of the fact that this concerned very, very many people in the Assyrian Empire. This is not something that was applied to a small minority. This would be something that people would have been likely to experience in their lives, and they would have been very familiar with this, okay?** So the phenomenon that we are talking about is often described as deportation. We can also use the term population management, then it sounds slightly more benign. We are looking at a state that assumes so much power over all its inhabitants that the state says, “you live here, you live there. And I don't have to make any other statement to explain this but that you are part of this state, that is it.” So this was non-negotiable.

If the Assyrian state was of the opinion that a certain group of people was better suited to live elsewhere, then it was done. Then it was implemented. We have to, however, also emphasise that the goal was not to punish, the goal was not to kill. The goal was to make use of the labour that these people represented in the way that was considered best for the state. So we are talking about a very invasive state, but one who is very, very aware that there is nothing more precious available than human labour and human ingenuity.

![Untitled](Organizing%20an%20Empire%2081a77c1360bd4f7cbbb1170f7f1e274c/Untitled%2017.png)

And that, of course, sets the Assyrian Empire drastically apart from the way humans are often considered in the 21st century. So with these basic observations, let's look at one particular case. I want to point out the triangle that stands for central Assyria. And we'll want to emphasise again that, in the known cases, 85% of people were resettled in the Assyrian heartland. That means that by the seventh century, the Assyrian heartland is the most densely populated region of the Assyrian Empire. But the rest of the realm is not empty. Whenever people were deported, we are talking about complicated arrangements, prolonged arrangements.

![Untitled](Organizing%20an%20Empire%2081a77c1360bd4f7cbbb1170f7f1e274c/Untitled%2018.png)

And I want to showcase this with one example, one of the most famous examples: the deportations of the people of **Samaria** in the year 722 BC. At that time, Samaria, now located in Israel, was conquered by the Assyrian forces. And part of its population was being moved to other places within the empire. In my map you see red dots and green dots. The green dots are the destinations of the people from Samaria. Guzana in the Khabur Triangle, Dur-Šarruken in the Assyrian heartland, at that time the new centre of Assyria, and then far in Iran, the cities of the Medes. The red dots represent those cities whose inhabitants were relocated to live in Samaria. So we have several cities in what is today southern Iraq, and we have the city of Hamat, now Hama in Syria, that give people up and they are resettled here in Samaria. So we are talking about an exchange of population. We are talking about people leaving Samaria and being sent to other cities. And we are talking about people from elsewhere who are being relocated in Samaria.

![Untitled](Organizing%20an%20Empire%2081a77c1360bd4f7cbbb1170f7f1e274c/Untitled%2019.png)

We can say something about the time frame of all of this. Samaria was conquered in the year 722 BC. And the cities of the Medes, where part of the population from Samaria was relocated to, were only integrated into the Assyrian Empire in 716. So six years later. So obviously, no one from Samaria could be relocated to Iran before this had been achieved. **So in this case, just reconstructing one of several cycles of population resettlement, we have one where people from Samaria are sent to live in Iran. People from Iran we know were sent to live in Assur, in the Assyrian heartland. And people from Assur were sent to live in Hamat, whereas people from Hamat were again made to live in Samaria.** So a very complicated circular movement is in operation here. And we are talking about a time frame of six years in this case. And on the whole, we have to be aware of the fact that organising this would have been very, very complex and complicated.

![Untitled](Organizing%20an%20Empire%2081a77c1360bd4f7cbbb1170f7f1e274c/Untitled%2020.png)

So lots of people were involved in managing this. This was, again, one of these very expensive strategies of the Assyrian Empire, but it was well worth it, because the state, by doing that, guaranteed that in the heartland, the best-educated, the best-trained people would be living, would be working, to the higher glory of the Assyrian Empire. Now, let's look at what kind of people were being relocated. This decoration from one of the Assyrian palaces shows the siege and the conquest of a city in Egypt. We can't identify the city precisely, but this is part of the River Nile and we are not concerned with the scenes of conquest here. We are concerned with this detail here. In this detail, we see a row of people leaving the city. And we have men, we have women, and we have children, and they have a lot of stuff.

Whoever designed this image wanted to showcase that they are taking all their things, and that's why there are all sorts of containers. Those are the typical containers of ancient Assyria, of course. We've got wooden boxes, we've got pottery vessels, we have baskets, we have leather vessels - all sorts of things. The point being, they are leaving with their possessions. They are not leaving empty-handed, and they are leaving as a family. That's what is indicated here by the children looking back at their father. And that's also something that is backed up in the texts. People were deported in a family context, with their possessions. Nothing was rushed, this was all done in a very organised way and it took years. Despite the fact that in the decorations in the palaces, the time frame is of course shortened very much. And the conquest, the siege, the deportation of the inhabitants is all conflated in one image. But it did not all happen at the same time.

Now the people from this Egyptian city we know were relocated in the Assyrian heartland. A great many of people from Egypt were relocated to central Assyria from the year 671 onwards. And as far as we can tell, their destination was, in each case, the centre of Assyria. We find them in texts from Nineveh and Assur, living there then for several generations. **Now the big, important difference to the circular movements of population that we've described is that in this case no one was sent back to Egypt. Thousands, thousands of thousands, of Egyptians were moved away from Egypt after the Assyrian army had conquered the Nile Delta, but no one was sent back. This was a one-way street, because Egypt was never integrated into the Assyrian Empire. Therefore, the Assyrian king did not see any need to replace the population was taken away from Egypt.** While the state saw to it that within the borders of the provincial system there wouldn't be any empty gaps. This was no concern at all when it came to regions outside of these borders. There basically every person that could profitably be relocated in Assyria was taken. And we have to be aware of the fact that an outcome of making this triangle the most densely populated region in the Middle East was also that the regions outside of the Assyrian provincial boundaries had to give up populations. And the long term impact, of course, was very, very dramatic.

## **Assyrian History, Part 4: The Covenant**

This is the city of Nineveh, the new capital of the Assyrian Empire and King **Sennacherib** rules from here. In 681 BC things start to go wrong. His crown prince Esarhaddon is far away in Anatolia leading a military campaign there when two of his brothers, two disgruntled princes, attempt to gain the crown for themselves and kill Sennacherib. Esarhaddon returns with the army, takes back Nineveh. But his brothers, the murderous princes, flee to Urartu and have the King of Urartu give them asylum. Esarhaddon succeeds to the throne, he's the king of Assyria. He's supported by his wife, Queen Ešarra-hamat and by his mother, the queen mother Naqia. When his wife dies in 674 BC this is considered such a momentous event that even sources from outside of Assyria comment on it.

This seems to have prompted Esarhaddon to reflect about what would happen after his death and begin planning for his succession with his retinue of scholars who came from all over the empire. And they come up with the idea of a covenant. >> [APPLAUSE] >>

The covenant was designed to bind the entire empire to the wishes of King Esarhaddon and to guarantee the succession of two of his sons. **Assurbanipal** was appointed Crown Prince of Assyria while his twin brother, **Šamaš-šumu-ukin**, was appointed Crown Prince of Babylon, because Esarhaddon, like his direct predecessors, was not only King of Assyria, but also held the crown of Babylon. Upon his death, however, he did not want this situation to continue; he wanted Assurbanipal as king of the Assyrian empire no longer to also be the direct overlord of Babylon. This was a position he wanted for his other son, Šamaš-šumu-ukin.

The covenant was imposed in 672 and was meant to make absolutely certain that the princes in exile in Urartu could never, ever claim the throne. The queen mother Naqia also imposed her own covenant on the immediate family. Again, with the goal to unite the empire according to the wishes of Esarhaddon. And when he died, his wish came true. His son Assurbanipal succeed to the crown of Assyria, supported by the powerful and long-lived Naqia and Šamaš-šumu-ukin took the crown of Babylon.

The covenant had thereby proven to be a very, very successful tool to keep the empire going and the people of Assyria started to see it as a powerful entity in its own right. The people started to see the covenant as a deity and all over the empire temples have been found where the covenant was revered as a deity in its own right

## How Do We Know About Esarhaddon's Covenant?

![Untitled](Organizing%20an%20Empire%2081a77c1360bd4f7cbbb1170f7f1e274c/Untitled%2021.png)

How do we know about Esarhaddon's covenant of 672 BC? There are a lot of sources about that: letters from the vault of correspondence, the inscriptions of Esarhaddon. But the most important source are the manuscripts of the actual covenant. I'll show you one, here. In contrast to the replicas that we've used so far, they were always smaller than the actual objects. This now is different. The actual object would be about this size. So this is blown up.

And this is one of eight manuscripts found in the city of Kalḫu during the excavations in the 1950s headed by Max Mallowan. He is best known unfortunately, because he was of course one of the most important archaeologists of his day, but he's best known as the husband of Agatha Christie, the crime novelist, who also was on site in Kalḫu at the time. So this was found in the 1950s. Lots and lots of pieces of course, the tablets had been broken into hundreds of fragments. And in 2009, another tablet was found in a completely different place in the ancient city of Kullania, that's the site of Tell Ta'yinat on the Orontes river in the Hatay region of Turkey, quite close to the Mediterranean Sea.

So we've got nine more or less complete copies of individual covenant tablets. And then, there is one fragment from the city of Assur. So, the covenant tablets were stored in various parts of the empire. And that's clear already from the fact that in this part, it is mentioned that different contract partners swore the oath. So these are client rulers and the provincial governors of the empire, most importantly. And they took the oath on behalf of all the people that they were in command of.

I’ll read some passages to you from this very, very long document. It's more than 670 lines arranged in eight columns, but we’ll only look at some in order to highlight what Esarhaddon wanted to achieve with this. So first of all, he wanted to make sure that his son Ashurbanipal, would succeed him as the king of Assyria when he died.

And so it says in the document, “On the day that Esarhaddon king of Assyria your lord, passes away, on that day Ashurbanipal, the great crown prince designate, the son of Esarhaddon your lord, shall be your king and your Lord. He shall abase the mighty, raise up the lowly, put to death him who is worthy of death, and pardon him who deserves to be pardoned. You shall hearken to whatever he says, and do whatever he commands, and you shall not seek any other king or any other lord against him.”
So, this in a very succinct way, of course tells us that the king of Assyria has absolute power. And as soon as Esarhaddon is no more, Ashurbanipal will be in this role. And everyone who takes the oath agrees to this, years before this scenario is meant to take place, of course. And you will remember that Esarhaddon came up with the idea to impose the covenant shortly after his wife, Ashur-hamat, had died, when he was it seems very, very aware of the fact that he too would die at one point. So, he wanted to make provisions.

And the situation during his reign were of course a bit special because he had come to the throne in a succession war. There were his brothers who had killed their father Sennacherib. And while Esarhaddon was able to retake the capital city of Nineveh, he was not able to capture his brothers. They fled. And they fled to the enemy kingdom of Urartu in the mountains. And therefore, there are provisions in this document that bind the oath-takers to the promise that they will never support any other pretenders from the royal family. Because everyone of course, who was part of this royal clan had in theory, the right to be king. And if they managed to come to the throne, they were legitimate simply by being members of that royal family.

**Killing your predecessor was in theory, not problematic. It just showed, if you succeeded that Aššur had chosen you. But Esarhaddon wanted to make sure that the people of Assyria would not lend support to any other pretender to the throne.** And therefore, it says here, “you” (that's the people taking the oath), “shall not help anyone from among Ashurbanipal's brothers, his uncles, his cousins, his family, or members of his father's line. Whether those are in Assyria, or those have fled to another country.” So, very explicitly of course, referring to the fact that there are members of the Assyrian royal family in another country.

So, the covenant very, very, much is meant to make sure that Ashurbanipal and also his brother, Šamaš-šumu-ukin who is appointed as crown prince of Babylon, will succeed to the throne without any trouble. A seamless transition of power is what is Esarhaddon has in mind here. And this is what this covenant is meant to signify to whoever looks at the tablet

 So I'm looking at this tablet, and I notice these interesting images right here. What are these? These are the seal impressions of three seals that belong to the god Aššur. This one is the youngest. It said, that time maybe 10, 15, years old, was created during the reign of Esarhaddon's father, Sennacherib. This one is much older. That's 700 years old at that point, was created by one of the predecessors of Esarhaddon who already was king of Assyria. And this is older still, this is more than 1,000 years old at the time. This is from before the time that there was a kingdom of Assyria.

This is when the city of Assur was the entity that was important. And so, we've got three seals that are personally, in a sense, owned by the god Aššur. And they are impressed here. And this is also mentioned on the top of the tablet. So, this is the only line that you are meant to read like this following the entire width of the tablet. And I'll read what it says here.

**It says, “sealing of the god, Aššur, king of the gods, lord of the lands, not to be altered. Sealing of the great ruler, father of the gods, not to be disputed.”** So the entire document is put under the god's protection by virtue of being sealed with his seal. We've talked about seals before, and private people in Assyria owned seals and whenever they impressed their seal, the transaction was linked to them. They gave their permission. They showed that they were there. The act of sealing creates this very direct relationship between the object that is being sealed and the person whose seal is being used, in this case, the entity who possesses the seal, god Aššur. So the tablet is more than just an ordinary tablet. It's imbued with the power of Aššur. Aššur guarantees that nothing that is in this covenant will be violated, will be disputed, will be altered in any way. And it gives the covenant a special power, and that covenant text refers to this when it says, you, being the people taking the oath, you shall guard this covenant tablet, which is sealed with the seal of Aššur, king of the gods, and set up this tablet in your presence like your own god.

So, if it's suggesting that you're to set it up like a god, does that mean that we were to worship it? And if so, how did that work? Yeah. Well, to set up this tablet like your own god very clearly refers to the fact that people were meant to worship it. And when these manuscripts in Kalḫu who were found this puzzled historians very much. How would that work? What does it even mean? **In 2009, as I said, another copy of the covenant was found in the provincial capital of Kolonia, and there, the tablet was found inside a small temple with an altar. In the back of the temple, there where normally you'd expect to have the statue of the deity put in place, but instead of a statue, there was a covenant tablet.** So the covenant was exhibited like a statue in this temple, and people were meant to come, and not just pay homage to it, but really pray to it - worship it like a deity. And in Assyrian texts, the covenant tablet is always written with the divine symbol. It is a special cuneiform character that signifies that the name that follows is that of a deity. So this sign is used for the covenant and in legal texts dating to the period after Esarhaddon's succession arrangement came into force when he died in 669 when the whole thing proved successful, legal tablets often include a clause that was meant to protect the transaction, the business transaction against violation and that clause is “the covenant of the king may take revenge” on whoever contravenes the transaction.

So people started to really believe in this deity, in the covenant. So it was then conceived as a deity that would protect arrangements, legal arrangements, oath and so on and would take revenge if they were violated. And since the find in Tell Tayinat in ancient Kullania, we now know that the copies of the covenant that were given to the treaty partner were then really put on public display in dedicated temple structures. And that of course is very interesting in a world where it is impossible to ever take the god Aššur out of his city and his temple in Assur, because these covenant tablets were so very, very closely associated with the god Aššur by means of the sealing. And so in a sense, this allowed the god Aššur to be more, much more present in people's lives than ever before.

## Reading: Your Last Two Kings

### **Esarhaddon, king of Assyria (reigned 681–669)**

### **Fighting for the crown**

Esarhaddon became king of Assyria against all odds, despite the fact that his father Sennacherib (704-681 BC) had made him crown prince in 683. However, he had not been the first choice. In order to have Esarhaddon installed as crown prince, Sennacherib first had to dismiss his son Arda-Mullissi, who had been crown prince and heir apparent to the Assyrian empire for well over a dozen years. Why Sennacherib did this, we do not know. Despite the fact that Arda-Mullissi had to swear loyalty to his younger brother, he strongly opposed his elevation and tried to get Sennacherib to revoke the appointment. The king did not comply, although the new heir was sent into exile for his own protection. Sennacherib does not seem to have realised just how much his decision to back Esarhaddon's promotion endangered his own life, for Arda-Mullissi was allowed to stay in his father's closest proximity, where he continued to plot. **In 681, Arda-Mullissi and one of his brothers stabbed Sennacherib to death, a deed that caused a stir all over the Near East.** Yet the aftermath of the murder saw friction between Arda-Mullissi and his conspirators; his accession to the throne was delayed and ultimately never took place at all. Assyria was in chaos when Esarhaddon, returning from exile with a small army, marched towards the heartland of the empire. He managed to drive out the murderers of Sennacherib and, two months after the assassination, he became king of Assyria.

These bloody events shaped the new king profoundly. Esarhaddon ordered all conspirators and political enemies within reach to be killed; yet he could not touch the leader of the conspiracy. Arda-Mullissi had found asylum in Urarṭu, Assyria's northern neighbour in Anatolia and its long-standing arch enemy. At that time, chances were that Arda-Mullissi still might become king and in that event, the Urartian king could reasonably expect to gain substantial influence over Assyria. In the meantime, Esarhaddon made an effort to ensure that his brother had no powerful allies at home, should he ever try to stage a coup d'etat from his exile: officials throughout the country who were suspected of entertaining sympathy for the enemy faction were replaced. To give but one example, the entire security staff at the royal palaces of Nineveh [](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/saao/knpp/peoplegodsplaces/index.html#ninevehplace)and Kalhu [](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/saao/knpp/peoplegodsplaces/index.html#calahkalhuplace)was dismissed - not sent into retirement but executed. Henceforth, Esarhaddon met his environs as a rule with overwhelming distrust. Routinely, he sought to establish by means of divination whether certain courtiers, officials or even members of the royal family wished him ill or to actively do him harm.

### **A successful king**

Esarhaddon proved himself a successful regent who consolidated his kingship and efficiently prevented segregation and territorial losses. Vassals, who had thought Assyria weakened and had tried to benefit from this, had to come to the painful realisation that Esarhaddon fully controlled his governors and his army and was able to take revenge for treason just as his predecessors had done. As a consequence, the vassal kingdoms of Sidon [](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/saao/knpp/peoplegodsplaces/index.html#sidonplace)(on the Phoenician coast) and Šubria [](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/saao/knpp/peoplegodsplaces/index.html#ubriaplace)(in Anatolia) were conquered and turned into Assyrian provinces. The completion of a peace treaty with Elam, Assyria's long-standing rival in Iran, in 674 BC must be seen as a skilful political manoeuvre. The securing of the eastern border provided Assyria with its first chance ever to exploit the power vacuum in Egypt to its own advantage. Assyria's first invasion of Egypt, however, resulted in a hasty retreat after defeat by Taharqa, the ruler of Nubia who had proclaimed himself Pharaoh. But in 671 Egypt was conquered and became an Assyrian vassal state.

### **Esarhaddon’s illness**

Despite these successes, Esarhaddon was increasingly hampered by his poor physical condition. He was constantly struck with illness, mostly rather severe. For days he withdrew to his sleeping quarters and refused food, drink and, most disturbingly, any human company. The death of his beloved wife Ešarra-hamat in 673 BC may well have further damaged his already fragile health. For the all-powerful king of Assyria, this situation was bizarre. Esarhaddon's counsellors witnessed his deterioration first with apprehension and then with increasing objections, but of course they were in no position to actually change this state of affairs. It is testament to Assyria's sound administrative structure that the country could take the king's continuing inability to act his part. It is easy to muster considerable sympathy for Esarhaddon, whose symptoms were indeed rather alarming. As we know from the correspondence left by the royal physicians and exorcists, his days were governed by spells of fever and dizziness, violent fits of vomiting, diarrhoea and painful earaches. Depressions and fear of impending death were a constant in his life. In addition, he was disfigured by a permanent skin rash that covered large parts of his body and especially his face. In one letter, the king's personal physician - certainly a medical professional at the very top of his league - was forced to confess his ultimate inability to help the king: "My lord, the king, keeps telling me: 'Why do you not identify the nature of my disease and find a cure?' As I have already told the king in person, his symptoms cannot be classified.". It is not entirely clear whether the sickly Esarhaddon contracted one illness after the other or, as would seem more likely, suffered from the afflictions of a chronic disease that never went away. Be that as it may, in a society that saw illness as a divine punishment, a king who was constantly confined to the sick bed could not expect much sympathy and understanding. **He could, however, reasonably presume that his subjects saw his affliction at the very least as an indication that the gods lacked goodwill towards their ruler, if not as the fruit of divine wrath, incurred by committing some heinous crime. Therefore, the king's condition needed to be hidden from the public by all means possible. That this was at all feasible was very much facilitated by the ancient tradition that whoever came before the king had to be veiled and on their knees.**

### **Power sharing with his sons**

Because of his failing health, Esarhaddon saw himself permanently in death's clutches. This alone made it necessary to provide for his succession: who would be king after him? There were a great many possible candidates; he himself had fathered at least 18 children. At one point, a son called Sin-nadin-apli [](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/saao/knpp/peoplegodsplaces/index.html#sinnadinapliperson)was deemed a suitable candidate, as demonstrated by a extispicy query addressed to the sungod. However, it was Assurbanipal who was elevated to the rank of crown prince of Assyria in 672 BC at the same time that his elder brother Šamaš-šumu-ukin [](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/saao/knpp/peoplegodsplaces/index.html#amaumuukinperson)was declared crown prince of Babylon. Subsequently, both crown princes were deeply involved in matters of political and cultic importance. Such a division of power must have appealed to all those who wished to see the sick king's burden lightened: it seems that a socially acceptable way of coping with an unpleasant and dangerous situation had been found.

In 669, Esarhaddon set out for a campaign against Egypt, which had risen in rebellion. He died on the way to the Nile. As far as we know, his death was natural and unexpected. Thus ended Esarhaddon's reign and, as planned, Assurbanipal ascended to the Assyrian throne, while his brother Šamaš-šumu-ukin became king of Babylon.

## **Assurbanipal, king of Assyria (reigned 669–c.630)**

Assurbanipal, the last "great" king of Assyria, was a younger son of king Esarhaddon and his queen Ešarra-hamat and the grandson of king Sennacherib [](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/saao/knpp/peoplegodsplaces/index.html#sennacheribperson)and the formidable Naqi'a. Married to queen Libbali-šarrat, he ruled from 669 until at least 630 BC; the last years of his reign are so poorly documented that it is difficult to establish when precisely he was succeeded by his son Aššur-etel-ilani.

### **Egypt regains its independence**

Assurbanipal (Ashurbanipal) was appointed crown prince [](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/saao/knpp/technicalterms/index.html#crownprince)of Assyria in 672 BC and ascended to the throne uncontested in 669 after Esarhaddon had died en route to Egypt, in order to end an anti-Assyrian rebellion supported by the Nubian king Taharqa [](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/saao/knpp/peoplegodsplaces/index.html#tarquperson)and his troops. Assurbanipal continued his father's military campaign to Egypt and the Nubians were forced out, with Necho [](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/saao/knpp/peoplegodsplaces/index.html#nechoperson)prince of Sais being installed as the new pharaoh of a newly united Egypt under Assyria's supremacy. Yet in 664 Taharqa's nephew and successor Tantamani again made a bid for Nubian control over Egypt but the swiftly dispatched Assyrian army succeeded in driving out the Nubians, this time for good. Assurbanipal had Necho, fallen in battle, replaced with his son Psammetikh. The new pharaoh had previously been living in Nineveh [](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/saao/knpp/peoplegodsplaces/index.html#ninevehplace)as a royal hostage but subsequently managed to gain complete independence from Assyria while keeping relations relatively friendly; he is considered the founder of the 26th dynasty, which ruled Egypt until the Persian conquest.

### **Two royal brothers fighting for Babylon**

In 672, when Assurbanipal was chosen as Assyrian crown prince, his older brother Šamaš-šumu-ukin [](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/saao/knpp/peoplegodsplaces/index.html#amaumuukinperson)was simultaneously appointed to be crown prince of Babylon. This meant that upon the death of Esarhaddon, who had jointly ruled Assyria and Babylonia, the realm was split into two: Assyria was Assurbanipal's kingdom while Šamaš-šumu-ukin was to be king of an independent Babylonia. The reality, however, was less like the dual monarchy that Esarhaddon may have had in mind; Assurbanipal considered his brother an Assyrian vassal and reserved a prominent role in Babylonian religious und public life for himself. The situation became increasingly volatile, especially when the friendly relations between Assyria and Elam, which Esarhaddon had initiated, disintegrated. Pro-Elamite, and anti-Assyrian, influence in Babylonia began to grow. The Assyrian army finally invaded Elam in 653 and according to the Assyrian point of view, Elam was from that moment on a vassal state. In practice, the Assyrian control over Elam was brittle, and this became obvious once Šamaš-šumu-ukin, with the support of Elam and other enemies of Assyria, renounced Assyrian hegemony, or more precisely his brother Assurbanipal's. In 652, the king of Babylon claimed pre-eminence over Assyria, declaring Assurbanipal to be nothing but the Babylonian governor in Nineveh, and this led to open war. The Assyrian army was dispatched to Babylonia and, after four years of brutal war and at great cost to the Babylonian people, finally gained control over the country in 648 BC. Šamaš-šumu-ukin is thought to have committed suicide when Babylon was taken. Assurbanipal refrained from proclaiming himself king of Babylon but instead installed as ruler one Kandalanu, whose origins and personality are so shadowy that the fairly unlikely hypothesis that he was really an alter ego of Assurbanipal's still finds occasional support among modern historians.

### **Assurbanipal – crafty survivor or paranoid coward?**

With the costly war in Babylonia and Egypt and Elam slipping out of Assyria's control, Assurbanipal's reign cannot easily be deemed successful, and yet he managed to stay on the throne for more than 40 years - much longer than his predecessors. Moreover, he seems to have avoided becoming the victim of a conspiracy like those that had haunted the reigns of his father and grandfather. It is clear that Assurbanipal, unlike previous Assyrian kings, rarely saw military action. Instead of leading the troops into battle the king did not even accompany the army on campaign - this may have considerably prolonged his life span but must be considered a radical departure from the expected behaviour of Assyria's ruler. **While the Assyrian army was invading Elam Assurbanipal was back in Nineveh praying for success; but when the army returned victorious he took the leading role in the re-enactments of the battles and the triumphant processions that included the parading and public torturing of the most prominent captives. Such performances aside, he seems to have led an isolated existence, protected and screened off from his subjects by his body guards and the thick walls of his lavish palace in Nineveh, the richly decorated stone sculptures of which can today be admired in the British Museum.**

### **The royal scholar**

**Assurbanipal famously not only knew how to read and write, but was highly educated to the standard of a true scholar. In the words of a group of twelve scribes who helped him assemble the vast collection of cuneiform literature today known as Assurbanipal's Library he was learned in "the entire corpus of scribal learning, the craft of Ea [](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/saao/knpp/peoplegodsplaces/index.html#eadeity)and Asalluhi [](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/saao/knpp/peoplegodsplaces/index.html#asalluhideity)(i.e. the performing of rituals), the divination series *Šumma izbu [](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/saao/knpp/technicalterms/index.html#ummaizbu)*and *Šumma alu*, the exorcistic [](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/saao/knpp/technicalterms/index.html#exorcist)corpus, the lamentation corpus, the song corpus and all other scribal learning", and similar statements can be found in his official inscriptions:**

I learnt the lore of the wise sage [](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/saao/knpp/technicalterms/index.html#sage)Adapa, the hidden secret, the whole of the scribal craft. I can discern celestial [](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/saao/knpp/technicalterms/index.html#celestial)and terrestrial [](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/saao/knpp/technicalterms/index.html#terrestrial)portents [](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/saao/knpp/technicalterms/index.html#portent)and deliberate in the assembly of the experts. I am able to discuss (the extispicy [](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/saao/knpp/technicalterms/index.html#extispicy)commentary) 'If the liver [](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/saao/knpp/technicalterms/index.html#liver)is a mirror image of the sky' with capable scholars. I can solve convoluted reciprocals and calculations that do not come out evenly. I have read cunningly written text in Sumerian, dark Akkadian, the interpretation of which is difficult. I have examined stone inscriptions from before the Flood, which are sealed, stopped up, mixed up.

Before his father Esarhaddon was chosen to inherit the Assyrian throne following the original crown prince Arda-Mullissi's [](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/saao/knpp/peoplegodsplaces/index.html#ardamullissiperson)disqualification, young Assurbanipal, a boy at the time, may well have been destined for a priestly career. Several of his brothers later on held high functions in Assyrian and Babylonian temples, and Esarhaddon himself, with his deep interest in the workings of rituals and his scholars' work, quite possibly came from a similar background. But while there can be little doubt that all Assyrian kings were literate, just like all other men born into the higher echelons of society and destined for a role in the running of the empire, it is not at all certain that rulers like Sennacherib, Sargon II, and Tiglath-pileser III shared Assurbanipal's high level of learnedness and his fascination with esoteric and arcane knowledge. This interest, however, certainly prompted him to use his military successes in Babylonia and Egypt to collect, by sheer force when needed, whatever library texts were available and to have them brought to his growing palace library in Nineveh. So organised was this effort that the king had search parties dispatched to Babylonia in order to locate rare scholarly works. Whether he was motivated by a thirst for knowledge (and the wish to control this knowledge) or rather a collector's voraciousness, today the library he created remains his most lasting monument.

# Week 6: The Fruits of an Empire

## Key Theme: Why an Empire?

![Untitled](Organizing%20an%20Empire%2081a77c1360bd4f7cbbb1170f7f1e274c/Untitled%2022.png)

The 9th century BC saw a novel use of the horse in warfare. While horses had been used to draw war chariots for hundreds of years, it was only now that the first cavalry units were formed. They quickly proved much more versatile and efficient than the traditional infantry and chariot troops. But imagine fighting on horseback with bow and arrow or with a spear at a time when stirrups had not yet been invented and the rider was sitting on a blanket rather than a saddle. This skill set required constant training and was, therefore, exclusively a job for professionals.

That is also true of fighting by chariot, but this had always been the preserve of members of the noble families, whose leisurely lifestyle meant that they could make time for practice.

With the rise of the cavalry's importance in Assyrian warfare and the need to muster large numbers of horseback fighters, the army's character shifted from being predominantly a conscript army to a largely professional army. **Conscript fighters fulfilled their obligation to serve the state by providing their labour and only served for part of the year. But professional warriors had to be paid all year round. And so, the Assyrian armed forces morphed into a standing army that was supplemented by seasonal conscripts and specialised mercenaries procured from the client states. The professional fighters were soldiers in the literal sense, as they drew a salary. Our word, soldier, after all, derives from a Latin term that means one who has pay.** And so, once the Assyrian state no longer cost-effectively relied on its subjects' duty to provide conscript army service, it was faced with a rather large bill to maintain its armed forces.

How to foot the bill? **How to balance expenses with revenue? An easy solution was to make the expensive army pay for itself by raiding the surrounding regions, or at least threaten to do so and demand payment to desist.** There's no doubt that this was a key reason why the Assyrian rulers of the first millennium BC tended to send their forces beyond their borders every year. The threat of the Assyrian forces kept the client rulers in line and made sure that they honoured their treaties. And these treaties guaranteed income in the form of tribute to the Assyrian crown.

But the Assyrian troops, despite their formidable numbers, were not the only armed forces to be reckoned with. Remember, that in the 11th century BC, Assyria had lost half of its former holdings to invaders. The shock of that loss had fuelled the reconquest in the 10th century. Subsequently, the danger of invasion still felt real, especially as Assyria knew the threat of Urartu, its northern rival in the Armenian Highlands. In the 9th century, the imperial Assyrian army was, therefore, not only an instrument to raise revenue from the neighbouring regions, but also tasked with the protection of the kingdom against its enemies.

Most of the standing army was stationed in four strategically located border marches. These heavily militarised zones were under the control of the four most powerful officials of the realm. They held ancient court titles, “Cup Bearer”, “Palace Herald”, “Treasurer”, and “Second-in-Command”, and were usually eunuchs. Seen in this light, the bulk of the army would primarily seem to serve defensive purposes.

When we, therefore, ask ourselves, why bother with the burden of empire? Why claim not just the provinces, but also sovereignty over the neighbouring regions? Then, we have already touched on two aspects. On the one hand, there is the security aspect. Faced by serious regional alternatives such as Urartu in Syria, Anatolia and northern Iran, and the Nubian kingdom of Kush in the southern Levant sought to keep its allies categorically in line, by exercising invasive control, by creating unequal power relationships that turned treaty partners into master and servant.

On the other hand, there is the profit aspect. Forcing the neighbouring regions into these unequal relationships meant that, while Assyria offered protection from its own forces and those of its rivals, the client states had to pay tribute. Depending on their natural resources and their location, this could be animals, especially horses and cattle, raw materials, such as gold, silver and copper, timber and building stone, or finished goods, such as dyed textiles and luxury vessels. The client state was obliged to deliver the tribute to wherever the Assyrian king stipulated, so transportation costs did not cut into the profit.

**There is no question that the Assyrian kings were very conscious of the vast material benefits that they were reaping from the empire. When King Tiglath-pileser III built a new palace in the capital city of Kalḫu, he gave this building and its gate a name as tradition demanded.** The names he chose make the advantages of empire very clear. He says, “I named it the Palatial Halls of Joy, which bear abundance, which bless the king, and which make the builder long lived. I named the gates, Gates of Justice, which give the correct judgment for the rulers of the four quarters of the world, which offer the yield of the mountains and the seas, and which admit the produce of mankind before the King, their Lord.”

But were there any altruistic motives at play? We have already stressed, in another context, that there was no attempt to proselytise the cult of the god Aššur, although he was the overlord of the Assyrian king who was thought to act on his behalf.

However, it is clear that the Assyrian states sincerely believed that the fruits of empire were not only reaped by the king and his court, by the capital and Assyrian heartland, all of whom greatly benefitted from the distribution of people, wares, and wealth into the imperial centre.

**A key strategy of the Assyrian state was to put unused or underused land under the plow. Therefore, large scale infrastructural measures were taken to improve water provisions in marginal agricultural regions, such as in the Syrian steppe, especially by implementing artificial irrigation. Moreover, new agricultural techniques were introduced wherever suitable. These included bee keeping, and the cultivation and processing of flax, fruit, wine, and olive oil.**

All this was linked to the extensive centrally-directed resettlement program that saw population groups moved across great distances in order to best serve the needs of the “land of Assur”. The explicit goal was the creation of an integrated, economically highly developed culture and society of Assyrians. Was the Assyrian imperial project a mission to civilise the world? Perhaps, it is clear, in any case, that the Assyrian idea of civilisation was based on a lifestyle that favoured agriculture and a sedentary existence in well-appointed houses with the city at the heart of the community and its civic institutions. And it was this lifestyle that was disseminated all across the regions of the empire.

If we focus on this aspect, the Assyrian empire, undoubtedly an avaricious exploitative entity, can almost seem benevolent.

## Talking about Luxury

So we are wealthy, at least well-to-do, urban Assyrian ladies living in the heartland of the empire. We would definitely drink wine not beer because beer isn't a luxury item and we would be very keen to ostentatiously live a lifestyle that is fitting the Assyrian Empire. And that's why we would go for wine. And especially, if we lived in the seventh century BC when wine had left its original connotations as a luxury item that was consumed in temples and in palaces.

By the seventh century, because of the wealth that was accumulated due to the empire, the well-to-do families in the heartland routinely drank wine, even the women drank wine. And that went so far as that the citizens of the city of Assur would send out trade expeditions with the explicit purpose to bring back wine.

**So speaking about the 9th-7th century BC, luxury goods would be consumables, foodstuffs - we've already mentioned wine - high-quality textiles. We have discussed, of course, the fact that in terms of the economy of the Assyrian Empire, sheep, flocks played a very significant role.** This was when we discussed the environment. So wool obviously, is then the most important fabric that the Assyrian people would be wearing. As the influence of the empire became ever greater, linen made out of flax, a plant fiber, became more widespread. Never, however really endangered the domination of wool. And later on, cotton and silk started to play a role, but really only in the highest levels of society. Some tombs of Assyrian queens have been excavated, and some of their garments were made of cotton and of silk which would have probably been imported at that point. So the most usual types of fabrics would be wool, some linen, and the difference would then be in colour. Yeah. So a white, brown, black, everything that would occur naturally, would be the least expensive fabrics. And everything that requires dye, especially hard to make therefore expensive dye, would be considered luxurious.

And the most important colour would be red. Why is that? Well, until now, red has of course this, or purple really, has this association with royalty even though now, if you see someone wearing a red T-shirt, we would think, "Oh, my God, that must be an exceptionally wealthy person." Don't think that anymore because our dyes, our colours are artificial, our chemical colours. But until the 19th century, that was of course very different. In any type of dye that is created either by grinding up expensive stones or, as in the case of red, grinding up rare little mollusks that only occur in a particular part of the eastern Mediterranean coast - anything that requires so much effort and labour is bound to be rare, and therefore expensive, and therefore a hallmark of high social and economic status. And that was more than anything true of the colour purple but also all kinds of blue. But red was considered the colour of royalty in Assyria, and if you saw someone wearing red garments, you knew this was most likely a member of the royal court or at least someone who was in close contact with the royal court.

When the Assyrian king wanted to honour someone, he would give them red cloth and golden things. A golden sword, a golden cup, something like that, because this was what was typically reserved to the King and to those closest around him. So the colour red was very expensive, was very rare and therefore of course, something that people aspired to wear, to own. There was not a great range of different garments available in the Assyrian Empire. Men and women largely dressed in identical garments, which is true for much of the ancient world, of course. So they would wear sort of tunics, woollen tunics typically. So like a long T-shirt that come down to your knees, short-sleeved typically and over that short undergarments. They would wear a wrap-around dress if you will, like a toga essentially - a long piece of fabric that you would wrap around yourself in order to suit your specific needs.

And people wore shoes. Again, you don't need to wear shoes, so shoes of course are then a good object to display your high social status with. And people would wear sandals or boots depending on context and season of course. But typically, you could not really tell their social standing by the shape of their garments or the cut of their garments because that was very simple as we said, a long T-shirt and the wrap around shawl, but by the quality of the textiles, by the colour and by the decoration of the garments. So it's the details that matter here a great deal. 

So thinking about fabric, as you've just just been discussing, or thinking about wine and thinking about this idea of quality, was there a wine that was particularly coveted or a fabric that was considered to be particularly fine that would only be worn by the wealthy and seen as a luxury good? Yeah. Well, I think we'd covered that for the textiles. **With the textiles, it's really the colours. If you've got a decoration with a gold thread or something like that, that would really signal, this is the best that can be. And that quality matters, that also goes for the wine. And, in a way, one can say that Assyrian culture is the first to foster this idea of connoisseurship, of terroir, when it comes to wine.**

So, the origin is very important that you as the consumer understand what you are drinking, that you know that you are now drinking wine from wherever. That's all important. Where is the wherever? Where does the best wine come from? Well, there are two regions that the Assyrian consumer would be very, very, very fond of. One is wine from Izalla. And Izalla is the region of modern-day Tur Abdin, that's part of the Taurus Mountain range that separates Turkey from Syria today. And the Tur Abdin, that's a volcanic area so that influences, of course, the taste of the wine. It's still a wine area. There are still Christian monasteries there and they need wine. On the whole, wine nowadays in the Middle East is not a big thing due to the fact that in Islam alcohol is forbidden. But in Christian areas, some very, very ancient vineyards are surviving and the Tur Abdin is one of them.

So, that's easily reachable in a way in a world that sees the Euphrates and the Tigris as the main lines of communication, because the Tur Abdin is accessible from the Tigris. So, you could bring wine from Izalla relatively easily down to Assur and Nineveh if you wanted to do that. And you would not ship the wine in bottles because they didn't have bottles. They did have glass but they used glass basically as replacements for gemstones. Yeah. So, small ersatz glass stones in a way for a blue lapis lazuli or something like that.

They were not yet technically able to create big glass containers, so wine was never bottled. Instead the wine was put into wineskins, so animal skins. And if you had to transport it down the Tigris, as you had to if you wanted to bring wine from Izalla to Assur, you would tie several of these wineskins together, a couple of dozens, and create a raft out of them. Put some timber on top. I’ve already said timber is also something that you need very much in order to build your house for the roof or for the door. And then you would basically ship down your raft to your consumers in the Assyrian heartland. And only there would you fill the wine into other containers. And those, again, wouldn't be small like this. They would be quite large vessels that would be stored in cool areas. And wine would then be taken out as it was consumed and it was mixed with water always. So, there's this whole drinking culture that therefore also is important because you mix the wine with water. You need several vessels, you don't just need the bottle and the wineglass, that's not all. No, no you need to fill the wine into a vessel. Then you have to have another vessel with water, then you mix it, then you let it go through a sieve, and so on and so forth. So, it's all quite complicated until you finally have your wine in the container from which you will drink it. And that is not a glass but a bowl that you balance on the tips of your fingers like this. And it, of course, creates a natural obstacle to getting too drunk.

Okay, so as I said one region is Izalla and it's sort of reasonably well-connected to the consumer in the Assyrian heartland. The other wine that becomes more and more popular, especially in the 7th century, is from a region that is until now, again, well-known for its wines near Damascus. So, it's a totally different scenario, of course, because to get wine from the region of Damascus to northern Iraq, that requires a long, long, long, long, long trip for that wine, some of which can't be achieved by just shipping it on a river. Because the good thing about that is that the river water would cool the wine, and would hinder it from becoming vinegar. So, that of course means that if you must drink wine from the Damascus region in Assur, and then you tell your drinking companions about it, that does a great deal for your prestige. Because you would say, well what we are drinking here is not wine from Izalla, although that’s very nice and, our families have been drinking this for the past hundred years. No, this is wine from Syria. This is actually wine from a khulb unud, that's how it's called. This is wine from the Damascus area. And let me tell you, it was a nightmare to get it here. Half of it's spoiled. But you know this, you know.

**And so this, of course, is totally unnecessary if all you want to do is drink wine, drink the wine from Izalla and be happy with it. Drinking wine from Damascus in central Assyria is nothing but showing off. Is nothing but proving to your peers and to whoever is interested that you can afford to make this extra effort to use resources to bring something that you might as well procure more locally to your own dinner table. And by doing that, these customers in the Assyrian heartland imitated the behaviour of the king.** The king, of course, had been doing this for a long time. The king had been the person who could dazzle whoever came to join him in the feast, in a banquet, with exotic foods, with exotic wines. And it was really at the heart of the imperial project, if you will. So, if you came to the city of Kalhu during the reign of Ashurnasirpal in the 9th century, when this city was inaugurated as the new capital, there was a huge banquet. We actually know the list of foodstuff that was served there because Ashurnasirpal felt that this was so important that he committed that to an inscription, that he put into the most important courtyard of his palace. So, we know what they drank, how much wine they drank, and so on and so forth.

And the people in the well-to-do households of cities like Assur they imitated this behavior by making a big deal about the provenance, especially the exotic provenance, of the foods that they drink. So, again, quality or provenance is what matters here. And that's, in a way, what the people of Assyria appreciated about the empire. The fact that it gave them the opportunity to source things that they might not necessarily need and to make statements about their social standing, about their economic possibilities, about their meaning, their standing in the world by just going about in their normal usual way, by dressing however very expensively, by consuming expensive foodstuff.

**Well, luxury it enabled social distinction and social layering. And that was considered desirable by the state. The state wanted the people of Assyria to be able to express their social standing in this way and encouraged them to do this.** As we said, people are imitating court life. This starts at the court. And the idea of luxury as something that turns a necessity into something that is desirable and aspirational. It starts at court in that when you dine with the Assyrian king, according to the fabric, the material from which your dinner service is made, reflects your social standing as seen by the king. **So, the more important you are, the better quality your bowls are. And the highest ranking members of court society would use gold, then comes silver, then comes bronze, and then comes various qualities of ceramics. And this introduces this idea of luxury into society, I would say, because it creates a desire to have the better quality ware. To not be happy and content with your very nice clay bowl from which you can drink wine just as well as from the golden one, but to aspire to the better type of material because that highlights your standing in this society.** And then basically, there's this desire to have the better quality, to show it off and so on. That turns people in the Assyrian Empire to participants in this project of the Assyrian Empire to create a diverse and socially-structured society where everyone sort of knows their place. And the closer you are to the centre of things, to the palace, the better you are.

## Assyrian History, Part 5: The End of Assyria

It's the year 652 BC. The god Aššur resides in his temple in the city of Assur, and in Nineveh Assurbanipal is king of Assyria while his twin brother Šamaš-šumu-ukin is king of Babylon, just like their father Esarhaddon wanted it. The relationship between the two countries, however, sours when in 652 B.C., Assurbanipal starts a war against his brother, thinking that his brother has conspired against him. The civil war takes several years and in 648 B.C. 

Šamaš-šumu-ukin dies, and Assurbanipal prevails. He replaces him with a puppet king called Kandalanu. And for a time, this situation is stable, but the situation is very, very bad for the Assyrian empire. Because in a world where not even the king’s brother can be trusted to keep his oath of loyalty, who can you trust?

When Assurbanipal dies, he is replaced by a boy, Assur-etel-ilani, his son. This child is not only fatherless but also motherless and he has a guardian called Sin-šumu-lešir, the chief eunuch of the Assyrian empire. When Kandalanu of Babylon dies shortly after, this man Sin-šumu-lešir takes the opportunity and appoints himself King of Babylon, and this leads to rebellions both in Assyria and in Babylon. In the course of the conflict, both Sin-šumu-lešir and Assur-etel-ilani disappear. Sin-šumu-lešir definitely is killed by the hands of a Babylonian leader called Nabopolassar becomes King of Babylon - the first native king in a very long time. Assur-etel-ilani's fate is less clear: he disappears, probably dies.

In any case, he is succeeded by his brother and this brother has a very interesting name. It is Sin-šarru-iškun and that name is no way fit for the King of Assyria. The name means the moon god has appointed the king. That's a very good name for a loyal official who serves the king but not for the king. We don't know why a child succeeded Ashurbanipal. We don't know why Sin-šarru-iškun didn't take the throne immediately. We don't know why he didn't change his name; it's all unclear.

But in the year 626 BC, Sin-šarru-iškun is now king of Assyria and Nabopolassar is king of Babylon. Nabopolassar uses the the next decade to consolidate his power in Babylon. And in 616 BC he assembles the Babylonian army and leads it against the Assyrian heartland. At the same time, the Medes from the mountains of Iran also assemble their forces and marched against Assur. And in 614 BC they not only conquer the city of Assur, they also destroy the temple and therefore cause the abandonment of the temple, and the city, and the country by the god Aššur. The Babylonian army arrives as well.

They swear an oath of mutual support and march against Nineveh, where in 612 BC the city falls, the last king, Sin-šarru-iškun, dies, and the remnant Assyrian forces retreat to the western city of Harran where a ruler called Assur-uballit II takes power. He shares his name, of course, with the very first king of Assyria. And he awaits together with his allies, the Egyptian forces, the final battle which takes place in 608 BC. The Medes and the Babylonians come to Harran, Assur-uballit dies, the Assyrian army is abolished.

The Medes retreat to Iran, and in the next two decades, the Babylonians and the Egyptians fight a vicious battle for the remainders of the Assyrian empire - a fight which is won by the Babylonians. And under Nebukadnezar, the son of Nabopolassar, Babylon becomes the predominant power of the Middle East and inherits the ancient cities of the Assyrian heartland, including Assur and Nineveh. And very importantly, the people of the Assyrian heartland are being moved to Babylon, making that city not only the biggest city in the world but also the city with the most highly educated population, turning this city into the centre of the world. And that was how the mighty Assyrian empire came to an end.

## How Do We Know About The End of Assyria?

Our main source are the so-called Babylonian Chronicles. I'll show you one.

Look, so this template for example relates events from the reign of King Nabopolassar of Babylon who managed to secede from the Assyrian empire, as you may remember. And here is the year 614 B.C. when the city of Assur was conquered. And I'll read the passage to you.

“In the twelfth year of King Nabopolassar in the fifth month, the Medes were en route to Nineveh. And the king of Assyria pushed forward with the help of his army. They took possession of Tarbisu, a town in the district of Nineveh. They went along the Tigris and set up camp before the city of Assur. They joined battle in the city, and they demolished…” …the passage is broken, but it must be this… “the temple of god, Aššur.” “They inflicted a formidable defeat on a great people. Pillaged and plundered them and robbed them. The King of Babylon and his troops, who had gone to the aid of the Medes, did not arrive in time for the battle. The city was taken. The king of Babylon and Cyaxares, king of the Medes, met outside the city and concluded a mutual accord and a total peace. Later, Cyaxares and his troops returned to their own country. And the king of Babylon and his troops returned to their own country.” So this is in the middle of these events that lead then ultimately to the loss of the political capital, Nineveh, the retreat to the city of Harran in the west. And the ultimate loss of the empire under the last ruler, Aššur-uballiṭ II. And each of these lines marks, really, the end of one of these yearly accounts. They are very detailed. They, in a sense, are quite objective. You will notice that the Assyrians are called the great people. And things like that make us argue that such texts, such chronicles, are less biased then, say, Assyrian inscriptions, that usually have nothing pleasant to say about any of the enemies of the Assyrian king. But, one has to stress, of course, that the Babylonian Chronicles are very, very much written from the viewpoint of Babylon.

And this is not a Assyrian cuneiform, this is Babylonian cuneiform. And indeed, the individual characters look, sometimes, very, very differently. The sequence of the individual impressions can differ. And the way you hold the stylus while writing is different from Assyrian. **Assyrian characters, on he whole, are sort of oriented very much in a horizontal direction. So the wedges tend to have long tails because you hold the stylus in a horizontal position. When you write Babylonian, you hold the stylus quite differently. In a sense, in a vertical position. So it looks as if the individual characters are running together over the lines. So if one knows cuneiform, then without even reading,at a glance, you can tell whether it's Assyrian or Babylonian.** So this is a Babylonian text. It's, of course, written after these events. This text continues on the backside into the later years of Nabopolassar's reign when Assyria doesn't exist anymore. And the text is not a contemporary source. The composition may have been put together while this happened. But this is a manuscript that was copied much later. Maybe in the sixth century, maybe even later. We don't quite know where it's from. It may be from the city of Borsippa, close to Babylon. But in any case, this type of information was copied by people who were interested in learning about the history of Mesopotamia. So this is, in a sense, the Babylonian equivalent to the histories of the Greeks, to the narrative accounts of Herodotus or Thucydides. From a Babylonian perspective and also an Assyrian perspective, history was very much an activity that required sorting events according to years. So lists, in a sense, were the all-important principle here.

## Ask the Experts: The Lasting Achievements of the Assyrian Empire

What do you think are some of the lasting achievements of the Assyrian Empire? What I see for the lasting achievement of the ancient Assyrian, Neo-Assyrian Empire is that they established essentially a series of social changes whether directly as part of their policies, or perhaps accidentally, or even indirectly, a series of social changes that have profoundly affected not only the ancient Assyrians, but also our modern day societies. Whether we look at our ancient religions, our social structures, our trade patterns, our languages, artistic kinds of reflections and other kinds of material culture, a lot of these begin to change from the time of the Neo-Assyrians until later. I feel like the Neo-Assyrian empire really instigated a series of social changes that essentially influence our own worlds, whether it's through the economy, or through religion, or language. All these things we can see some repercussions of the ancient Assyrians somewhere in there. Well, clearly, the Assyrian empire's political structure had a substantial impact on later states. The Babylonian empire that followed in translatio imperii was the first one to emulate, especially in its bureaucracy, structures the Assyrians had been the first implement, including the provincial structure. It had a core area with the Assyrian king in charge and then numerous provinces where you had provincial governors who were responsible to the Assyrian kings, a pretty clearly defined chain of command, very elaborate road systems and so on and so forth. Later empires essentially followed this model as well. The Assyrians have shaped the concept, the very concept of Empire. They built an empire, a large empire, the largest empire which existed up to date and it existed for many, many generations. So it was an important milestone in human history. So the lasting achievements of the Assyrian empire I will classify them in two categories. The first one would be the idea of how to run an empire, how to create an empire, how to rule it. That was an important Assyrian innovation that was transmitted through the Babylonians through the Persians. On the other hand, they had a very important role as transmitters of the literary tradition of Mesopotamia that they collected and transmitted to the later periods. Keeping up Babylonian and Sumerian culture, copying all these texts and providing these enormous libraries which were then known, copied and transmitted later. Furthering the sciences, furthering the study of man, economics. So the 7th century in particular the Assyrians were certainly an empire which was ready to make a leap. Unfortunately, it made a leap into nothing because it was destroyed, but it was not followed by a similar empire, a similarly cultured empire in the near east. It would take a long time for another empire to accumulate so much culture and knowledge as the Assyrians did. I regard the collection of knowledge as evidenced in the Royal Library of Ashurbanipal and infrastructural innovations such as super-regional communication networks as lasting achievements of Assyria. Obviously the postal service. Without the Assyrian empire we wouldn't have mail and who can imagine a world without letters and postmen? I would say the democratisation of the wine consumption because more people were drinking wines than the previous period, probably, during this period. Yes, for me that would be the best achievement. Well, I mean the Assyrian empire was the largest empire the world had seen up until that point, covered a large area, ruled large numbers of people and collected a lot of wealth and so it left us great art, fabulous documents. I mean, the largest and best collection of scholarly literary documents comes from the Assyrian capital of Nineveh. It's left us an awful lot of information about the history, the culture, the religion of the ancient world. Simply writing it down, preserving it, leaving it for us, I think is its greatest achievement. Well, I think on many levels the Assyrians were the heirs of earlier Mesopotamian states. Much that has to do with writing, and bureaucracy, and literature, and religion is not necessarily new or unique to Assyria. It's given an Assyrian twist if you will, but it's not necessarily absolutely original because it's part of what Assyriologists often referred to as the stream of tradition. But I think when it comes to the arts which decorated - the wall reliefs which decorated Assyrian palaces, metres and metres and metres of graphic representations of campaigns, of religious rituals, of the countryside that they controlled in varying degrees, but usually very realistic, varying degrees of realism but usually very realistic, very well sculpted. I think and these are really a lasting achievement in the sense that since they've, examples of these were excavated in the 1840s and subsequently some have gone, in that early date, some were taken away, taken out of Assyria and are now in museums around the world. And so people really can see the kind of wall reliefs and the kind of imagery that Assyrian kings and the court and foreign ambassadors and dignitaries would have seen. It's a great contribution I think to world art in a broad sense. The creation of powerful images with a tendency towards naturalistic realism. The greatest single achievement is Assyrian art, both the magnificent winged-headed bulls and the amazing sculpted reliefs. The Assyrians are also great canal builders. For example, there's a canal northwest of Nineveh which brought water from the hills above Nineveh to the city itself, an amazing achievement that we don't know how it was built. Finally there's one thing I'd like to mention which is in effect I hesitate to call an achievement of the Assyrians and that's the result of their policy of deportations. Moving people, transplanting them across the empire, creating disruptions and uprootings which have left reverberations across the Middle East to this day. Oh, my initial thoughts are always towards the Mesopotamian intellectual heritage such as astronomy, but that really is a lasting achievement of the Babylonians rather than the Assyrians. The Assyrians are really well known for their battle techniques and their battle equipment. They really were the masters of war, especially the siege. So I would say their ability to devise complex and cunning battle strategies. Of course, making or creating an empire is not something that comes without a cost especially to those, the governed. As Walter Benjamin famously said, there is no such thing as a document of civilisation that isn't at the same time also a document of some kind of barbarian thing, and that applies to Assyria as well. The Assyrians were, of course, are still are famous for being particularly violent in their approach. And while it is true that this applies to others as well, both in the Ancient Near East, Egypt and Greece and Rome and all over the place, it must be said that there are a few ancient civilisations that relish so much in promoting their violence through various means of propaganda, whether it's the text the Assyrians produced or the images they left on the walls of their palaces. So the creation of this empire came at a cost. I'm honestly very skeptical about using the word achievement in the context in any empire. Actually something that I really like and value about studying the Assyrian empire is I think in contrast to other empires like for instance the British empire or the Roman empire, there isn't this very emotional sort of attachment or feeling of heritage really when it comes to the Assyrian empire. I think that because of that it's far easier to study it as what I personally think of an empire as which is an attempt by a very few people to make lots of money and to benefit from the exploitation of others.
